# Physical Logic Framework (PLF)

> A deterministic foundation for quantum mechanics through prescriptive logic

## Overview

The Physical Logic Framework (PLF) treats logic as **prescriptive**—actively constraining physical reality—rather than merely descriptive. PLF resolves quantum measurement through deterministic selection while reproducing all experimental quantum correlations.

### Key Innovation

Instead of modifying logic to fit quantum mechanics, PLF maintains that physical reality must conform to classical logical constraints (identity, non-contradiction, excluded middle). A deterministic selection functional resolves measurements without randomness or world multiplication.

### Experimental Validation

PLF achieves universal parameter success (λ=1) across five major Bell test datasets:
- Hensen et al. (2015) - Diamond electron spins: **S = 2.398** vs experimental 2.42 ± 0.20
- Shalm et al. (2015) - NIST photons: **S = 2.682** vs experimental 2.70 ± 0.05  
- Giustina et al. (2015) - Vienna photons: **S = 2.351** vs experimental 2.35 ± 0.18
- Handsteiner et al. (2018) - Cosmic Bell test: **S = 2.404** vs experimental 2.416 ± 0.094
- Storz et al. (2023) - Superconducting circuits: **S = 2.0752** vs experimental 2.0747 ± 0.0033

**Mean deviation: 0.011** with **same parameter across all platforms**
