You are an expert in measure theory, functional analysis, information theory, and mathematical foundations of physics.

CONTEXT: Logic Field Theory (LFT) proposes that physical reality emerges from logical filtering of an "Infinite Information Probability Space" (I2PS) via the equation A = L(I).

CURRENT PROBLEM: Peer reviewers (from Physical Review X / Nature Physics level) have identified critical gaps:

**Reviewer Critique #1 (Gemini-2.0)**:
"The paper lacks a precise mathematical definition of the Infinite Information Probability Space (I2PS). What is the measure on this space? What are the allowed operations? Without this, the entire framework rests on shaky ground. The term 'information' is used loosely, and a clear connection to Shannon information, Kolmogorov complexity, or a related rigorous concept is needed."

**Reviewer Critique #2 (Gemini-2.0)**:
"The central equation, A = L(I), is presented without sufficient mathematical justification. What is the nature of the operator L? Is it linear? What are its properties? How does it map elements of the I2PS to 'Actuality'?"

CURRENT INFORMAL DESCRIPTION (from paper):

**I2PS Informal**:
- "Infinite directed graphs on N elements"
- "All possible ordering relationships among N elements"
- "Information space where each point represents a potential ordering"

**Operator L Informal**:
- L = EM ∘ NC ∘ ID (Excluded Middle ∘ Non-Contradiction ∘ Identity)
- "Filters information space based on logical consistency"
- Maps I2PS → Physical Actuality

**YOUR TASK**:

Provide a rigorous mathematical formalization of I2PS and operator L that would satisfy top-tier physics journal reviewers.

**Specifically address**:

1. **I2PS Measure Space Definition**:
   - What is the underlying set Ω?
   - What is the σ-algebra Σ?
   - What is the measure μ?
   - How does this connect to information theory (Shannon, Kolmogorov)?
   - For N elements, what is the specific construction?

2. **Operator L Definition**:
   - Is L linear, nonlinear, or something else?
   - What are its domain and codomain precisely?
   - What mathematical properties does L satisfy?
   - How do the three components (ID, NC, EM) compose?
   - What does "logical filtering" mean mathematically?

3. **Born Rule Connection**:
   - The paper claims to derive P(outcome) = |⟨ψ|outcome⟩|² from constraint counting
   - How would this derivation work rigorously?
   - What's the connection between counting valid arrangements and quantum probabilities?

4. **Permutohedron Geometry**:
   - For N elements, the symmetric group S_N has N! permutations
   - These form an (N-1)-dimensional permutohedron
   - How does constraint filtering on this space relate to quantum state space?

5. **Example: N=3 Case**:
   - Provide complete mathematical construction for N=3
   - Show explicitly how I2PS, L, constraints, and quantum emergence work
   - Include measure theory, constraint counting, probability derivation

**FORMAT**: Provide complete mathematical definitions using standard notation (measure theory, functional analysis). Be as rigorous as a Mathematical Physics paper in Annals of Mathematics.

**GOAL**: Give me definitions I can put directly into Section 3 of the paper that will satisfy expert reviewers demanding mathematical rigor.
