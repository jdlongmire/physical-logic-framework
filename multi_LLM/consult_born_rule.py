You are an expert in quantum foundations, mathematical physics, and rigorous probability theory.

CONTEXT: Logic Field Theory (LFT) claims to DERIVE (not postulate) the Born rule P(outcome) = |⟨ψ|outcome⟩|² from constraint counting on a permutation space.

PREVIOUS FORMALIZATION (from Gemini-2.0):

We have defined:
- I2PS as measure space (Ω, Σ, μ) where Ω = ∏ Sₙ
- Operator L: P(Ω) → P(O) that filters based on logical constraints
- For N elements, constraint C defines valid permutations

CURRENT CONNECTION (SKETCH):

1. Constraints C → projectors Pᵢ on Hilbert space
2. Effective Hamiltonian H = ∑ᵢ Pᵢ
3. Ground state |ψ⟩ of H satisfies constraints
4. Probability P(outcome) = N_C,outcome / N_C (constraint counting)
5. Claim: |⟨ψ|outcome⟩|² ∝ √(N_C,outcome / N_C)

PROBLEM: This is heuristic, not rigorous.

PEER REVIEW CRITIQUE (Gemini-2.0):

"The derivation of the Born rule from constraint counting is a crucial claim. However, the paper provides insufficient details to assess its validity. Specifically:
- What types of constraints are being counted?
- How is the counting performed?
- What is the mathematical justification for equating relative frequencies with Born probabilities?
- How does this relate to Gleason's theorem?"

YOUR TASK:

Provide a RIGOROUS mathematical derivation of the Born rule from constraint counting that would satisfy expert reviewers in quantum foundations.

**Specific requirements**:

1. **Constraint-to-Hilbert Mapping**:
   - How exactly do constraints on Sₙ map to Hilbert space structure?
   - What is the dimension of the Hilbert space for N elements?
   - How do permutations correspond to basis states?

2. **Probability Derivation**:
   - Start with: P_LFT(outcome) = |{σ ∈ Sₙ : σ satisfies C and leads to outcome}| / |{σ : σ satisfies C}|
   - End with: P_QM(outcome) = |⟨ψ|outcome⟩|²
   - Prove equivalence rigorously (not heuristically)

3. **Gleason's Theorem Connection**:
   - Gleason: Any probability measure on Hilbert space has form P(E) = Tr(ρE) for density operator ρ
   - How does LFT constraint counting satisfy or circumvent Gleason's assumptions?
   - What is the ρ that emerges from constraint counting?

4. **N=3 Concrete Proof**:
   - Use N=3 example (S₃ with 6 permutations)
   - Constraint C: "element 1 precedes 2" → 3 valid permutations
   - Map to Hilbert space explicitly
   - Derive quantum state |ψ⟩ from constraint counting
   - Prove P(outcome) = |⟨ψ|outcome⟩|² from first principles

5. **General N Case**:
   - How does this generalize to arbitrary N?
   - What is the asymptotic behavior as N → ∞?
   - Connection to standard quantum mechanics for large systems?

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - Are there assumptions we're missing?
   - What are the limitations of this derivation?
   - When might constraint counting fail to give Born rule?

**FORMAT**: Provide theorem-proof structure suitable for a rigorous physics/math paper.

**GOAL**: Make the Born rule derivation bulletproof against expert scrutiny. If you find flaws in the approach, identify them clearly and suggest how to fix or reframe the claim.

**COMPARISON NEEDED**: How does this compare to:
- Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal
- Zurek's envariance approach
- Wallace's Deutsch-Wallace theorem in Many-Worlds
- Other attempts to derive Born rule
