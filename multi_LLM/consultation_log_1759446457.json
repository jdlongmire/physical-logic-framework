Current status: ConstraintAccumulation.lean compiles with 7 sorrys. I have these potentially trivial targets: 1) chsh_constraint_evolution (marked as definitional equality) 2) visibility_decay_theorem (marked as definitional equality). Both use 'unfold' + 'ring_nf' and claim to be definitionally equal. Should I target these first, or look for easier computational wins in other modules? Which specific sorry offers the best 5-minute implementation?\n\nCURRENT CODE:\n```lean\n\ntheorem temporal_ordering (\u03b5\u2081 \u03b5\u2082 : \u211d) (h\u2081 : \u03b5\u2081 > 0) (h\u2082 : \u03b5\u2082 > 0) :\n  \u03b5\u2081 < \u03b5\u2082 \u2194 C \u03b5\u2081 < C \u03b5\u2082 := by\n  -- Need to prove C(\u03b5) is strictly monotonic from positive derivative\n  -- ConstraintRate \u03b5 > 0 for \u03b5 > 0 (already proven)\n  -- But how to use MVT properly in Lean 4?\n  sorry\n\n```\n\nCONTEXT: Logic Field Theory formal verification - proving temporal ordering from constraint accumulation monotonicity\n\nSPECIFIC REQUESTS:\n1. Best approach to prove monotonicity from positive derivative in Lean 4\n2. What Mathlib theorems exist for Mean Value Theorem that I should use\n3. Alternative proof strategies that avoid MVT complexity\n4. Working Lean 4 code suggestions for immediate implementation\n\nPlease provide:\n- Concrete Mathlib theorem names and imports\n- Working Lean 4 code snippets\n- Step-by-step proof strategies\n- Alternative approaches if MVT is too complex\n\nFocus on actionable, implementable solutions with proper Lean 4 syntax.\n",
