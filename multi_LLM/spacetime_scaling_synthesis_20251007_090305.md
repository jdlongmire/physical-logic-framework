### 1. Dimension Estimation Methodology

The correlation dimension is a reasonable choice for estimating the intrinsic dimension of a dataset, especially for datasets that may have a fractal structure. However, it is indeed sensitive to sample size and noise, and may not be the best choice for small datasets or datasets with discrete symmetry.

Given the nature of your data (discrete, permutohedron structures), I would recommend considering the following alternative approaches:

### GEMINI Key Points:

Okay, this is a fascinating project! Let's break down your questions and provide some expert guidance.  I'll focus on providing actionable advice and pointing you towards relevant literature.

**1. Dimension Estimation Methodology**

*   **Assessment:** Correlation dimension is a reasonable starting point, but it's definitely not the *ideal* method given the discrete and finite nature of your data.  Its reliance on a continuous scaling relationship (C(r) ~ r^d) is problematic when you have a lim...
