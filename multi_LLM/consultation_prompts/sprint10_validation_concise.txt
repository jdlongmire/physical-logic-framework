# Sprint 10 Validation: Deriving Symmetrization Postulate from Logical Consistency

## Summary

We derived the symmetrization postulate of quantum mechanics from the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL) applied to indistinguishable particles. Key insight: Indistinguishability is an epistemic constraint (information limit), not an ontic property.

## Main Result

**Theorem**: If particles are indistinguishable (persistent labels not epistemically accessible), then only symmetric or antisymmetric states correspond to well-defined propositions.

**Proof**: Mixed-symmetry states require tracking "which particle is which," but this information is not accessible. Therefore, only symmetric (ψ(1,2) = ψ(2,1)) and antisymmetric (ψ(1,2) = -ψ(2,1)) states are logically consistent.

## Deliverables

### 1. Lean Formalization (280 lines, 0 sorry, builds successfully)

```lean
structure ParticleProp where
  description : String
  requires_label : Bool  -- Does proposition need persistent particle labels?

def WellDefinedProp (p : ParticleProp) : Prop := ¬ p.requires_label

inductive SymmetryType where
  | Symmetric : SymmetryType      -- ψ(1,2) = ψ(2,1)
  | Antisymmetric : SymmetryType  -- ψ(1,2) = -ψ(2,1)
  | Mixed : SymmetryType          -- Neither

theorem symmetrization_from_epistemic_consistency :
  IndistinguishableParticles →
  ∀ (s : SymmetryType),
    WellDefinedProp (symmetric_proposition s) →
    (s = SymmetryType.Symmetric ∨ s = SymmetryType.Antisymmetric)
```

**Proof method**: Case analysis. If s is Mixed, then it requires labels (by definition), contradicting well-definedness.

### 2. Computational Validation (Notebook 24)

**N=2 spin system**:
- Symmetric: (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2 → Exchange eigenvalue +1 ✅
- Antisymmetric: (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2 → Exchange eigenvalue -1 ✅
- Mixed: 0.8|↑↓⟩ + 0.6|↓↑⟩ → NOT an eigenstate (requires labels) ✅

**N=3 Young diagrams**:
- [3] symmetric: 1D representation (label-free) ✅
- [1³] antisymmetric: 1D representation (label-free) ✅
- [2,1] mixed: 2D representation (requires basis choice = labels) ✅

Complete mathematical exposition with:
- Epistemic vs ontic conceptual foundation
- Full proof with step-by-step justification
- Literature connections (QBism, Spekkens, Zeilinger, Pauli spin-statistics)
- Honest scope: Derived symmetrization, deferred boson/fermion distinction to Sprint 11

## Key Questions for Validation

### Mathematical Rigor (40%)
1. Is the proof of `symmetrization_from_epistemic_consistency` logically sound?
2. Does case analysis on SymmetryType cover all possibilities correctly?
3. Is the contradiction for Mixed states properly derived?
4. Any gaps in the mathematical argument?

### Conceptual Clarity (25%)
1. Is the epistemic vs ontic distinction clear and defensible?
2. Does "indistinguishability = information limit" make sense?
3. Why does mixed-symmetry require labels? (Hint: Not eigenstates of exchange operator)
4. Are the examples (N=2 spin, N=3 Young diagrams) illustrative?

### Integration (20%)
1. Do Lean formalization, notebook validation, and derivation paper agree?
2. Is the connection to Logic Realism Theory (LRT) clear?
3. Are literature references appropriate (QBism, Spekkens, etc.)?
4. Is the novel contribution (deriving symmetrization from 3FLL) clearly stated?

### Honest Scope (15%)
1. Is it clear what was derived (symmetrization) vs deferred (boson/fermion)?
2. Are limitations acknowledged (spin-statistics theorem → Sprint 11)?
3. Is 90% confidence for symmetrization appropriate?
