Current status: 1) ConstraintAccumulation.lean has critical compilation error: 'Unknown identifier HasDerivAt' preventing all builds. 2) FeasibilityRatio.lean has multiple sorries but no compilation errors. 3) Question: Should I fix the HasDerivAt import issue first (easy fix, unblocks compilation) or tackle specific mathematical sorries? Provide consensus ranking of top 3 tactical priorities for maximum impact with implementation guidance.\n\nCURRENT CODE:\n```lean\n\ntheorem temporal_ordering (\u03b5\u2081 \u03b5\u2082 : \u211d) (h\u2081 : \u03b5\u2081 > 0) (h\u2082 : \u03b5\u2082 > 0) :\n  \u03b5\u2081 < \u03b5\u2082 \u2194 C \u03b5\u2081 < C \u03b5\u2082 := by\n  -- Need to prove C(\u03b5) is strictly monotonic from positive derivative\n  -- ConstraintRate \u03b5 > 0 for \u03b5 > 0 (already proven)\n  -- But how to use MVT properly in Lean 4?\n  sorry\n\n```\n\nCONTEXT: Logic Field Theory formal verification - proving temporal ordering from constraint accumulation monotonicity\n\nSPECIFIC REQUESTS:\n1. Best approach to prove monotonicity from positive derivative in Lean 4\n2. What Mathlib theorems exist for Mean Value Theorem that I should use\n3. Alternative proof strategies that avoid MVT complexity\n4. Working Lean 4 code suggestions for immediate implementation\n\nPlease provide:\n- Concrete Mathlib theorem names and imports\n- Working Lean 4 code snippets\n- Step-by-step proof strategies\n- Alternative approaches if MVT is too complex\n\nFocus on actionable, implementable solutions with proper Lean 4 syntax.\n",

Fix the 'HasDerivAt' import issue: This is a critical compilation error that is blocking all builds. It's also an easy fix. You should always aim to have a codebase that compiles, even if it's not yet complete or correct. This will allow you to incrementally build and test your solution.\n\n2. Tackle the mathematical 'sorries': Once your code is compiling, you can start to address the 'sorries'. These are placeholders for parts of your proof that you haven't yet completed. By addressing these, you can start to make progress on your proof.\n\n3. Prove monotonicity from positive derivative: This is the core of your theorem, and it's where you'll need to do the most work. You'll need to use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) and the properties of the derivative to prove this.\n\nHere's how you might approach each of these tasks:\n\n1. Fix the 'HasDerivAt' import issue: This is likely due to a missing import statement. You should add the following line at the top of your file:\n\n```lean\nimport analysis.calculus.deriv\n```\n\nThis will import the definition of 'HasDerivAt' and related theorems.\n\n2. Tackle the mathematical 'sorries': This will depend on the specific 'sorries' in your code. However, you should aim to break each 'sorry' down into smaller, more manageable parts. You can then prove each part separately, and combine them to remove the 'sorry'.\n\n3. Prove monotonicity from positive derivative: Here's a step-by-step strategy:\n\n   a. Use the Mean Value Theorem: This states that if a function is continuous on the interval [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b), then there exists some c in (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval. In Lean, you can use the 'exists_deriv_eq_slope' theorem from the 'analysis.calculus.mean_value' module.\n\n   b. Apply the properties of the derivative: If the derivative of a function is positive on an interval, then the function is increasing on that interval. You can use the 'deriv_pos_imp_increasing' theorem from the 'analysis.calculus.deriv' module to prove this.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of how your proof might look:\n\n```lean\nimport analysis.calculus.deriv\nimport analysis.calculus.mean_value\n\ntheorem temporal_ordering (\u03b5\u2081 \u03b5\u2082 : \u211d) (h\u2081 : \u03b5\u2081 > 0) (h\u2082 : \u03b5\u2082 > 0) :\n  \u03b5\u2081 < \u03b5\u2082 \u2194 C \u03b5\u2081 < C \u03b5\u2082 :=\nbegin\n  split,\n  { intro h,\n    have h' : \u03b5\u2081 \u2264 \u03b5\u2082 := le_of_lt h,\n    have h'' : \u03b5\u2081 \u2260 \u03b5\u2082 := ne_of_lt h,\n    have h''' : 0 < \u03b5\u2082 - \u03b5\u2081 := sub_pos.mpr h,\n    obtain \u27e8c, hc\u27e9 := exists_deriv_eq_slope C h' h'' h\u2081 h\u2082,\n    -- Now use 'deriv_pos_imp_increasing' to show that C \u03b5\u2081 < C \u03b5\u2082\n    sorry },\n  { sorry } -- The reverse implication will depend on the specifics of your problem\nend\n```\n\nThis is just a rough sketch, and you'll need to fill in the details based on the specifics of your problem.
