I need to understand the exact imports and theorem names for: 1) HasDerivAt API for proving constraint_has_deriv_at, 2) Mean Value Theorem for monotonicity from positive derivative, 3) Taylor series approximation tools for exponential functions, 4) Small parameter analysis lemmas. What are the correct import statements and specific theorem names in this Mathlib version? Please provide working Lean 4 code patterns.\n\nCURRENT CODE:\n```lean\n\ntheorem temporal_ordering (\u03b5\u2081 \u03b5\u2082 : \u211d) (h\u2081 : \u03b5\u2081 > 0) (h\u2082 : \u03b5\u2082 > 0) :\n  \u03b5\u2081 < \u03b5\u2082 \u2194 C \u03b5\u2081 < C \u03b5\u2082 := by\n  -- Need to prove C(\u03b5) is strictly monotonic from positive derivative\n  -- ConstraintRate \u03b5 > 0 for \u03b5 > 0 (already proven)\n  -- But how to use MVT properly in Lean 4?\n  sorry\n\n```\n\nCONTEXT: Logic Field Theory formal verification - proving temporal ordering from constraint accumulation monotonicity\n\nSPECIFIC REQUESTS:\n1. Best approach to prove monotonicity from positive derivative in Lean 4\n2. What Mathlib theorems exist for Mean Value Theorem that I should use\n3. Alternative proof strategies that avoid MVT complexity\n4. Working Lean 4 code suggestions for immediate implementation\n\nPlease provide:\n- Concrete Mathlib theorem names and imports\n- Working Lean 4 code snippets\n- Step-by-step proof strategies\n- Alternative approaches if MVT is too complex\n\nFocus on actionable, implementable solutions with proper Lean 4 syntax.\n",

The current version of mathlib is primarily compatible with Lean 3. Therefore, the specific theorem names and import statements you're asking for are not available in Lean 4 at this time.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with the Lean 3 equivalents and a general strategy for proving your theorem. Once mathlib is fully ported to Lean 4, you should be able to adapt this strategy to Lean 4.\n\nHere are the Lean 3 imports and theorem names you asked for:\n\n1. HasDerivAt API: `import analysis.calculus.deriv`\n2. Mean Value Theorem: `import analysis.calculus.mean_value`\n3. Taylor series approximation tools for exponential functions: `import analysis.special_functions.exp_log`\n4. Small parameter analysis lemmas: These are scattered throughout mathlib, but you might find `import analysis.asymptotics.asymptotic_equivalent` useful.\n\nHere is a general strategy for proving your theorem:\n\n1. Use the `has_deriv_at` API to prove `constraint_has_deriv_at`. This will involve showing that the derivative of your function `C` exists at all points in its domain. You can use the `deriv_within_univ` lemma to show that the derivative within the entire domain of `C` is the same as the derivative at any point in the domain.\n\n2. Use the Mean Value Theorem (`exists_has_deriv_at_eq_slope` in Lean 3) to show that if `C` has a positive derivative, then `C` is strictly increasing. This will involve showing that for any two points `a` and `b` in the domain of `C`, if `a < b` then `C a < C b`.\n\n3. Use Taylor series approximation tools to approximate `C` as an exponential function. This will involve showing that `C` is equal to its Taylor series expansion around any point in its domain.\n\n4. Use small parameter analysis lemmas to show that `C` is strictly increasing for small values of `\u03b5`. This will involve showing that the derivative of `C` is positive for small `\u03b5`.\n\nHere is a rough sketch of how you might implement this strategy in Lean 3:\n\n```lean\nimport analysis.calculus.deriv\nimport analysis.calculus.mean_value\nimport analysis.special_functions.exp_log\nimport analysis.asymptotics.asymptotic_equivalent\n\ntheorem temporal_ordering (\u03b5\u2081 \u03b5\u2082 : \u211d) (h\u2081 : \u03b5\u2081 > 0) (h\u2082 : \u03b5\u2082 > 0) :\n  \u03b5\u2081 < \u03b5\u2082 \u2194 C \u03b5\u2081 < C \u03b5\u2082 :=\nbegin\n  -- Prove `constraint_has_deriv_at` using `has_deriv_at`.\n  have h_deriv : \u2200 \u03b5, has_deriv_at C (constraint_rate \u03b5) \u03b5,\n  { sorry }, -- replace with your proof\n\n  -- Use the Mean Value Theorem to show `C` is strictly increasing.\n  refine \u27e8\u03bb h, _, \u03bb h, _\u27e9,\n  { obtain \u27e8c, hc, h_slope\u27e9 : \u2203 c in Ioo \u03b5\u2081 \u03b5\u2082, deriv C c = (C \u03b5\u2082 - C \u03b5\u2081) / (\u03b5\u2082 - \u03b5\u2081),\n    { apply exists_deriv_eq_slope C h, exact h_deriv \u03b5\u2081, exact h_deriv \u03b5\u2082 },\n    sorry }, -- replace with your proof\n\n  -- Use Taylor series approximation tools to approximate `C` as an exponential function.\n  -- Use small parameter analysis lemmas to show `C` is strictly increasing for small `\u03b5`.\n  sorry -- replace with your proof\nend\n```\n\nI hope this helps!

Use Taylor series approximation tools to approximate `C` as an exponential function. This will involve showing that `C` is equal to its Taylor series expansion around any point in its domain.\n\n4. Use small parameter analysis lemmas to show that `C` is strictly increasing for small values of `\u03b5`. This will involve showing that the derivative of `C` is positive for small `\u03b5`.\n\nHere is a rough sketch of how you might implement this strategy in Lean 3:\n\n```lean\nimport analysis.calculus.deriv\nimport analysis.calculus.mean_value\nimport analysis.special_functions.exp_log\nimport analysis.asymptotics.asymptotic_equivalent\n\ntheorem temporal_ordering (\u03b5\u2081 \u03b5\u2082 : \u211d) (h\u2081 : \u03b5\u2081 > 0) (h\u2082 : \u03b5\u2082 > 0) :\n  \u03b5\u2081 < \u03b5\u2082 \u2194 C \u03b5\u2081 < C \u03b5\u2082 :=\nbegin\n  -- Prove `constraint_has_deriv_at` using `has_deriv_at`.\n  have h_deriv : \u2200 \u03b5, has_deriv_at C (constraint_rate \u03b5) \u03b5,\n  { sorry }, -- replace with your proof\n\n  -- Use the Mean Value Theorem to show `C` is strictly increasing.\n  refine \u27e8\u03bb h, _, \u03bb h, _\u27e9,\n  { obtain \u27e8c, hc, h_slope\u27e9 : \u2203 c in Ioo \u03b5\u2081 \u03b5\u2082, deriv C c = (C \u03b5\u2082 - C \u03b5\u2081) / (\u03b5\u2082 - \u03b5\u2081),\n    { apply exists_deriv_eq_slope C h, exact h_deriv \u03b5\u2081, exact h_deriv \u03b5\u2082 },\n    sorry }, -- replace with your proof\n\n  -- Use Taylor series approximation tools to approximate `C` as an exponential function.\n  -- Use small parameter analysis lemmas to show `C` is strictly increasing for small `\u03b5`.\n  sorry -- replace with your proof\nend\n```\n\nI hope this helps!
