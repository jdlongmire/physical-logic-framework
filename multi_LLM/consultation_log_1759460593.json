The MVT states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists some c in (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval.\n\nHere is a general strategy for proving monotonicity from a positive derivative:\n\n- First, you need to show that the function is differentiable on the interval of interest. This can often be done using the `differentiable_on` function in Lean 4.\n- Next, you need to show that the derivative is positive on the interval. This can be done by applying the `has_deriv_at` function to each point in the interval and showing that the result is positive.\n- Finally, you can apply the MVT to show that the function is increasing on the interval.
