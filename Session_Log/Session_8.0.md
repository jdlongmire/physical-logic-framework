# Session 8.0 - Sprint 9: Mission Statement Refinement

**Session Number**: 8.0
**Started**: October 11, 2025
**Focus**: Mission Statement Refinement & Scope Alignment (Sprint 9)

---

## Session Overview

Beginning Sprint 9 to refine the Physical Logic Framework mission statement and align all repository documentation with:
1. What has been rigorously derived (Born rule, Schrödinger equation, measurement mechanism)
2. What is in progress or partially developed (field theory, many-body systems)
3. What are known limitations with proposed resolutions (indistinguishable particles)
4. The relationship between philosophical foundation (3FLL) and mathematical implementation (S_N structures)

**Sprint 9 Deliverables** (8 total):
- MISSION_STATEMENT.md (refined mission)
- SCOPE_AND_LIMITATIONS.md (honest boundaries)
- FALSIFICATION_CRITERIA.md (testable predictions)
- RESEARCH_ROADMAP.md (near/medium/long-term)
- Update all README files
- Update paper abstracts and introductions
- Comprehensive Lean status report
- Multi-LLM team consultation

## Phase 1: Mission Statement Refinement

### Starting Sprint 9
- Created Session_8.0.md
- Created SPRINT_9_TRACKING.md
- Updated sprints/README.md to mark Sprint 9 "In Progress"

### Deliverable 1.1: MISSION_STATEMENT.md ✅ COMPLETE

Created comprehensive mission statement document (~6,400 words) with:
- Mission Statement (dual mission: decompose to primitives, derive QM from logic)
- Core Conceptual Framework (3FLL with dual justification, I = ∏ S_n, A = L(I))
- What Has Been Derived (18 notebooks, 11 Lean modules, confidence levels)
- Current Scope and Boundaries (derived vs. hypothesized vs. out of scope)
- Falsification Criteria (testable predictions)
- The Gödel Argument (refined as "motivating argument" not "proof")
- Integration of philosophical and technical levels
- Research roadmap (near/medium/long-term)

### Deliverable 1.2: SCOPE_AND_LIMITATIONS.md ✅ COMPLETE

Created technical documentation (~5,800 words) with:
- High Confidence results (9 items: 90-99% confidence, 0 sorrys in Lean)
- Moderate Confidence results (5 items: 75-89% confidence, strategic axioms)
- Hypothesized results (4 items: speculative, 0% confidence)
- Known Limitations (6 items: honest gaps)
- Relationship to Standard QM (exact agreement in N→∞ limit, finite-N predictions)
- Summary table with confidence levels

### Deliverable 1.3: FALSIFICATION_CRITERIA.md ✅ COMPLETE

Created falsification specification (~5,400 words) with:
- Core hypothesis (A = L(I))
- 5 experimental falsification tests (interference visibility, spectral gap, entropy saturation, constraint threshold, 3FLL violation)
- 5 theoretical falsification tests (Born rule circularity, Hamiltonian-Laplacian equivalence, V_K Hilbert space compatibility, K(N) mathematical proof, Schrödinger derivation)
- What would NOT falsify (QFT, gravity, exchange statistics, strategic axioms, unmeasurable corrections, alternative interpretations)
- Experimental collaboration opportunities
- Commitment to scientific integrity (pre-registration of predictions)

## Phase 2: Repository Documentation Alignment

### Deliverable 2.1: Update All README Files (In Progress)

**Root README.md ✅ COMPLETE**:
- Updated Overview section to reference MISSION_STATEMENT.md
- Updated Computational Notebooks section (18 notebooks, ~65,000 words)
- Updated Current Status (Sprint 9 in progress)
- Updated Framework Status (High/Moderate/Hypothesized confidence categories)
- Added Falsification Criteria references
- Updated Research Focus (Sprint 9-10 goals)
- Updated Quick Start (Session_8.0.md reference)
- Updated Confidence Assessment table
- Updated Recent Session Output (Session 8.0, Sessions 7.1-7.4)
- Updated Research Context (mission, focus, publication targets)
- Updated Citation block (18 notebooks, 11 Lean modules)
- Updated final Status line (Sprint 9 Phase 1 complete)

**Remaining README files** (pending):
- notebooks/Logic_Realism/README.md (if exists)
- lean/LFT_Proofs/README.md (if exists)
- paper/README.md (if exists)

## Files Created/Modified (Total: 8)

### Created
- MISSION_STATEMENT.md (~6,400 words)
- SCOPE_AND_LIMITATIONS.md (~5,800 words)
- FALSIFICATION_CRITERIA.md (~5,400 words)
- Session_Log/Session_8.0.md
- sprints/sprint_9/SPRINT_9_TRACKING.md

### Modified
- sprints/README.md (Sprint 9 "In Progress")
- README.md (comprehensive updates, Sprint 9 alignment)
- Session_Log/Session_8.0.md (this file - progressive update)

---

## Key Achievements

**Phase 1 Complete** (~4 hours):
- 3 comprehensive mission documents created (~17,600 words total)
- Dual 3FLL justification (empirical + Gödel as "motivating")
- Confidence categorization for 18 results
- 10 falsifiable predictions pre-registered (October 11, 2025)
- Honest scoping ("core QM principles" not "complete QM")

**Phase 2.1 Partial** (~2 hours):
- Root README.md fully aligned with mission statement
- Removed overclaims, added references to new documents
- Updated statistics (18 notebooks, 11 Lean modules, 61% coverage)

## Next Steps

**Current Focus**: Phase 1 - Mission Statement Refinement
**Next Deliverable**: MISSION_STATEMENT.md draft

**To Resume**:
1. Read: Session_8.0.md (this file)
2. Review: MISSION_STATEMENT.md progress
3. Continue: Next phase of Sprint 9
