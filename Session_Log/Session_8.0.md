# Session 8.0 - Sprint 9: Mission Statement Refinement

**Session Number**: 8.0
**Started**: October 11, 2025
**Focus**: Mission Statement Refinement & Scope Alignment (Sprint 9)

---

## Session Overview

Beginning Sprint 9 to refine the Physical Logic Framework mission statement and align all repository documentation with:
1. What has been rigorously derived (Born rule, Schrödinger equation, measurement mechanism)
2. What is in progress or partially developed (field theory, many-body systems)
3. What are known limitations with proposed resolutions (indistinguishable particles)
4. The relationship between philosophical foundation (3FLL) and mathematical implementation (S_N structures)

**Sprint 9 Deliverables** (8 total):
- MISSION_STATEMENT.md (refined mission)
- SCOPE_AND_LIMITATIONS.md (honest boundaries)
- FALSIFICATION_CRITERIA.md (testable predictions)
- RESEARCH_ROADMAP.md (near/medium/long-term)
- Update all README files
- Update paper abstracts and introductions
- Comprehensive Lean status report
- Multi-LLM team consultation

## Phase 1: Mission Statement Refinement

### Starting Sprint 9
- Created Session_8.0.md
- Created SPRINT_9_TRACKING.md
- Updated sprints/README.md to mark Sprint 9 "In Progress"

### Deliverable 1.1: MISSION_STATEMENT.md ✅ COMPLETE

Created comprehensive mission statement document (~6,400 words) with:
- Mission Statement (dual mission: decompose to primitives, derive QM from logic)
- Core Conceptual Framework (3FLL with dual justification, I = ∏ S_n, A = L(I))
- What Has Been Derived (18 notebooks, 11 Lean modules, confidence levels)
- Current Scope and Boundaries (derived vs. hypothesized vs. out of scope)
- Falsification Criteria (testable predictions)
- The Gödel Argument (refined as "motivating argument" not "proof")
- Integration of philosophical and technical levels
- Research roadmap (near/medium/long-term)

### Deliverable 1.2: SCOPE_AND_LIMITATIONS.md ✅ COMPLETE

Created technical documentation (~5,800 words) with:
- High Confidence results (9 items: 90-99% confidence, 0 sorrys in Lean)
- Moderate Confidence results (5 items: 75-89% confidence, strategic axioms)
- Hypothesized results (4 items: speculative, 0% confidence)
- Known Limitations (6 items: honest gaps)
- Relationship to Standard QM (exact agreement in N→∞ limit, finite-N predictions)
- Summary table with confidence levels

### Deliverable 1.3: FALSIFICATION_CRITERIA.md ✅ COMPLETE

Created falsification specification (~5,400 words) with:
- Core hypothesis (A = L(I))
- 5 experimental falsification tests (interference visibility, spectral gap, entropy saturation, constraint threshold, 3FLL violation)
- 5 theoretical falsification tests (Born rule circularity, Hamiltonian-Laplacian equivalence, V_K Hilbert space compatibility, K(N) mathematical proof, Schrödinger derivation)
- What would NOT falsify (QFT, gravity, exchange statistics, strategic axioms, unmeasurable corrections, alternative interpretations)
- Experimental collaboration opportunities
- Commitment to scientific integrity (pre-registration of predictions)
