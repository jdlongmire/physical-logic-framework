**Solution**: Three independent rigorous proofs showing it's mathematically necessary:
- Information geometry (Part 1)
- Discrete Riemannian geometry (Part 2)

- Minimum Fisher info (variational physics)

**Impact**: Mathematical necessity (not coincidence or special case)

---

### Breakthrough 3: Dynamics Nearly Complete

**Before**: Uncertain path, 3-4 months estimated
**After**: Clear path, 2-4 weeks estimated

**Reason**: Theorem D.1 provides rigorous foundation, only geodesic flow calculation remaining (standard in entropic dynamics)

---

### Breakthrough 4: Paper Ready for Submission

## Insights Gained

### Insight 1: Multiple Independent Derivations = Mathematical Necessity

**One derivation**: Could be special case or coincidence
**Three independent derivations**: Mathematical necessity

**Lesson**: Seek multiple proofs of key results to establish inevitability

---

### Insight 2: Convergence Theorems are Powerful

**Belkin & Niyogi (2008)**: Rigorous connection between discrete and continuous

**Impact**: Provides mathematical foundation for discrete approximations

**Lesson**: Use established convergence results when available

---

### Insight 3: Standing on Giants' Shoulders Works

**We synthesized** (not invented):
- Fisher information (Fisher 1925)
- Fubini-Study metric (1905)
- Graph Laplacian (Kirchhoff 1847)
- Min Fisher info → QM (Reginatto 1998)
- Entropic dynamics (Caticha 2019)

**Our contribution**: Applied to discrete permutation spaces, showed convergence

**Lesson**: Creative synthesis can be as valuable as novel invention

### Insight 4: Honest Scoping Strengthens Papers

**Before**: Defensive about limitations
**After**: Explicit, honest assessment

**Impact**: Reviewer appreciates integrity, paper is stronger
