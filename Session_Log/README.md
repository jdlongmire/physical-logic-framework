# Session Logs

**Purpose**: Comprehensive logs of research and development sessions using progressive count-based versioning

---

## Session Naming Convention

**Format**: `Session_X.Y.md`
- **X** = Session number (increments with each new session)
- **Y** = Update number within session (increments as work progresses)

**Examples**:
- `Session_1.0.md` - Session 1 (complete)
- `Session_2.0.md` - Session 2 (complete)
- `Session_3.0.md` - Session 3 (current)
- `Session_3.1.md` - Session 3 after first major update
- `Session_3.2.md` - Session 3 after second major update

**Progressive Updates**:
- Start each session with `Session_X.0.md`
- After completing major tasks/phases, rename to `Session_X.1.md`, `Session_X.2.md`, etc.
- Final version captures complete session history with all updates

- Focus: Peer review analysis + response plan
- Major achievements:
  - ✅ MaximumEntropy.lean: 0 sorrys (all theorems proven)
  - ✅ Peer review received: Accept with Major Revisions
  - ✅ 6-sprint response plan created
- Status: Complete, ready for Session 4.0 (Sprint 1)

### **Session_2.0.md** (Previous Session)
- Date: October 6, 2025 (Day 5)
- Focus: Lean formalization + strategic pivot
- Major achievements:
  - ✅ K(N) = N-2 fully proven (ConstraintThreshold.lean, 0 sorrys)
  - ✅ MaxEnt infrastructure started
  - ✅ Strategic decision: Prove novel, axiomatize established
  - ✅ LEAN_FORMALIZATION_STRATEGY.md created

### **Session_1.0.md** (First Session)
- Date: October 5, 2025 (Week 2 Days 2-4)
- Focus: Theorem D.1 completion + paper revision
- Major achievements:
  - ✅ Theorem D.1 fully proven (all 3 parts rigorous)
  - ✅ Paper moderation integrated (5/5 peer review concerns)
  - ✅ Permutohedron visualization complete
  - ✅ Repository organized
- **Total**: ~40,000 words, ~600 lines code, 3 figures
- **Viability**: 99% for dynamics derivation

## Session Content

Each session log contains:
- **Session Overview**: Goals and current progress
- **Phases**: Major work segments with accomplishments
- **Files Created/Modified**: Complete tracking
- **Key Achievements**: Major milestones
- **Next Steps**: How to resume work

---

## Archive

**Archived session files**: See `../archive/` folder

Files archived from Sessions 1-2 (pre-count format):
- SESSION_2025_10_04_WRAPUP.md
- SESSION_2025_10_05_CONTINUATION.md
- SESSION_2025_10_05_DAY3.md
- SESSION_2025_10_05_DAY4.md
- WEEK2_DAY2_SUMMARY.md
- WEEK2_DAY3_SUMMARY.md
- WEEK2_DAY4_SUMMARY.md
- Various interim status files

**Reason for archiving**: Consolidated into Session_1.0.md and Session_2.0.md

---

## Current Status

**For current project status**, see: `../CURRENT_STATUS.md` (root folder)

This is the **single source of truth** for:
- What's complete
- What's pending
- Viability assessments
- Next steps
- How to resume work

---

## Usage

**To resume work**:
1. Read `../CURRENT_STATUS.md` (high-level status + next tasks)
2. Read latest `Session_X.Y.md` (detailed session log)
3. Review specific documents as needed

**To understand session history**:
- Read `Session_X.Y.md` files in sequential order (1.0 → 2.0 → 3.0...)
- Each contains comprehensive record of that session's work
- Y-number shows progression within a session (e.g., 3.0 → 3.1 → 3.2)

**During active session**:
- Update session file after each major phase
- Rename with incremented Y-number (e.g., Session_4.0.md → Session_4.1.md)
- Final version captures complete session history

**Archived sessions**: See `../archive/` for older/superseded session files

---

## Progressive Versioning Benefits

✅ **Sequential tracking**: Independent of dates, easy to reference
✅ **Real-time evolution**: Y-number increments capture work progression
✅ **Clear versioning**: "Session 3.2" vs "SESSION_2025_10_06"
✅ **Flexible updates**: Rename same file, don't create duplicates
