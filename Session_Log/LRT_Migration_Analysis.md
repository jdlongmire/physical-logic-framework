# LRT Migration Analysis: Approach 2 → Clean LRT Implementation

**Date**: October 25, 2025
**Purpose**: Systematic analysis of Approach 2 content to determine what to reference vs. rebuild in LRT

---

## Strategic Principle

**Approach 2 = Prototype** (lessons learned, archive for reference)
**LRT = Production** (clean, minimal axioms, focused scope)

---

## Content Classification

### Category 1: REFERENCE AS-IS (Archive, Don't Rebuild)

**Computational Validation from Approach 2 Notebooks**:
- ✅ N=3, N=4 permutohedron calculations (Notebooks 03-04)
- ✅ Constraint counting validation K(N)=N-2 (Notebook 17)
- ✅ Finite-N quantum corrections ~10^-8 (Notebook 13)
- ✅ Fisher metric geometry (Notebook 06)
- ✅ Lagrangian-Hamiltonian duality (Notebook 05)

**Why reference, not rebuild**: These are computational validations of mathematical results. They prove the math works. No need to duplicate - just cite results.

**Lean Formalization (140 axioms)**:
- ✅ Complete module structure (Foundations, LogicField, Dynamics, QuantumEmergence)
- ✅ 0 sorry statements
- ✅ Successful builds

**Why reference, not rebuild**: This represents significant formal verification work. It's a valid proof-of-concept. But we learned axiom count is too high. Reference as "Approach 2 formalization" in LRT, but rebuild cleanly.

**Papers (Session 14 transparency update)**:
- ✅ It_from_Logic_Scholarly_Paper.md
- ✅ Logic_Realism_Foundational_Paper.md (Session 14.6)
- ✅ Supplementary materials

**Why reference, not rebuild**: These contain important ideas and literature review. Mine them for content but don't duplicate. LRT will be new unified paper.

**Session Logs (Sessions 1-16)**:
- ✅ Complete development history
- ✅ Lessons learned (axiom inflation, nomenclature issues, etc.)
- ✅ Literature search results (K(N)=N-2 = A001892)

**Why reference, not rebuild**: Historical record of how we got here. Critical for understanding lessons learned.

### Category 2: REBUILD CLEANLY (Core LRT Implementation)

**Philosophical Foundation** (NEW - from LRT paper):
- 🔄 Section 2: Why logical constraints? (necessity argument)
- 🔄 A = L(I) ontological principle
- 🔄 3FLL as ontological operators (not epistemological tools)
- 🔄 Distinguish from Tegmark MUH, pancomputationalism, structural realism
- 🔄 Wheeler/Hardy/Chiribella/Caticha lineage

**Approach 2 equivalent**: None (this is new in LRT)
**Why rebuild**: This is the core philosophical innovation of LRT. Build from scratch professionally.

**Operator Formalism** (CLEAN - abstract level):
- 🔄 Π_id: Identity/persistence projector
- 🔄 {Π_i}: Incompatibility projector family
- 🔄 R: Resolution map (EM operator)
- 🔄 Constraint hierarchy: I → ℋ_Id → ℋ_NC → 𝒜

**Approach 2 equivalent**: InfoSpaceStructure (Session 15.0), symmetric groups
**Why rebuild**: Approach 2 mixed abstract and concrete. LRT keeps them separate - abstract operators first, then show S_N is one realization.

**Key Derivations** (FOCUSED):
1. 🔄 Time emergence (Stone's theorem)
2. 🔄 Energy as constraint measure (Spohn's inequality)
3. 🔄 Born rule from maximum entropy
4. 🔄 Quantum superposition = partial constraint (Id + NC)
5. 🔄 Measurement collapse = full constraint (Id + NC + EM)

**Approach 2 equivalent**: Scattered across 25 notebooks
**Why rebuild**: Focus on 5 core derivations cleanly. Approach 2 had ~15+ derivations across many notebooks. LRT is streamlined.

**Testable Predictions** (PRIORITIZED):
- 🔄 β ≠ 0: Quantum error correction entropy correlation (PRIMARY)
- 🔄 Finite-N corrections (SECONDARY, cite Approach 2 computational results)
- 🔄 Entropy saturation (TERTIARY)

**Approach 2 equivalent**: Finite-N corrections emphasized, β mentioned
**Why rebuild**: LRT inverts priority. β is the novel, near-term testable prediction. Finite-N is hard to test (~10^-8 effects).

**Minimal Lean Formalization** (TARGET: ~5-10 axioms):
- 🔄 IIS axiom (information space exists)
- 🔄 3FLL axioms (identity, non-contradiction, excluded middle)
- 🔄 Hilbert space axioms (maybe 2-3 for operator algebra)
- 🔄 Actualization axiom (A = L(I))

**Approach 2 equivalent**: 140 axioms across 4 modules
**Why rebuild**: We learned 140 is way too high. Start with bare minimum, prove everything else as theorems.

**Focused Notebooks** (TARGET: 9 notebooks):
1. 🔄 IIS and 3FLL Foundation
2. 🔄 Operator Formalism (Π_id, {Π_i}, R)
3. 🔄 Time Emergence (Stone's theorem)
4. 🔄 Energy as Constraint (Spohn's inequality)
5. 🔄 Born Rule Derivation
6. 🔄 Quantum Superposition (partial constraint)
7. 🔄 Measurement Problem (full constraint)
8. 🔄 β Prediction (QEC entropy correlation)
9. 🔄 S_N Realization (bridge to Approach 2)

**Approach 2 equivalent**: 25 notebooks (00-23 in Logic_Realism)
**Why rebuild**: Approach 2 explored many tangents. LRT is laser-focused on core derivations. Notebook 9 serves as explicit bridge showing S_N as one realization.

### Category 3: DISCARD (Tangential/Exploratory)

**From Approach 1** (already deprecated):
- ❌ All original permutation-based notebooks
- ❌ Early computational explorations

**Why discard**: Already deprecated in Approach 2. Archive only.

**From Approach 2 Notebooks** (exploratory content):
- ❌ Notebook 14: Gravity proof-of-concept (too speculative)
- ❌ Notebook 20-22: Predictions, comparative analysis (good ideas but out of scope for clean LRT)
- ❌ Notebooks 08-09: Energy level structure, time emergence details (covered in focused Notebooks 3-4)
- ❌ Notebook 10: Interferometry (example, not core derivation)
- ❌ Notebook 11: Qubit systems (example, not core derivation)
- ❌ Notebook 15-16: (if they exist, need to check)
- ❌ Notebook 18-19: (if they exist, need to check)

**Why discard**: These were valuable explorations but tangential to core LRT thesis. Reference results if needed, but don't rebuild.

**From Approach 2 Lean**:
- ❌ LogicField module (7 axioms) - may be redundant with cleaner operator formalism
- ❌ Indistinguishability module (17 axioms) - specific application, not foundation
- ❌ LogicRealism module (7 axioms) - redundant with new LRT foundation
- ❌ Excessive axioms in Foundations (18 → target 2-3)
- ❌ Excessive axioms in QuantumEmergence (72 → target 2-3)
- ❌ Excessive axioms in Dynamics (18 → target 1-2)

**Why discard**: We learned axiom inflation is a problem. 140 → 5-10 requires ruthless pruning. Many "axioms" should be theorems or definitions.

## Mapping: LRT Notebooks → Approach 2 References

| LRT Notebook | Core Content | Approach 2 Reference | Computational Validation |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| 01_IIS_and_3FLL | Philosophical foundation, A = L(I) | Paper Section 2-3 | Notebooks 00-01 (cited) |
| 02_Operator_Formalism | Π_id, {Π_i}, R definitions | InfoSpaceStructure (Session 15) | N/A (abstract) |
| 03_Time_Emergence | Stone's theorem, U(t) = e^{-iHt/ℏ} | Notebook 08 (time emergence) | Cite Approach 2 |
| 04_Energy_Constraint | Spohn's inequality, entropy | Notebook 05 (Lagrangian) | Cite Approach 2 |
| 05_Born_Rule | Maximum entropy → Born rule | Notebook 03 (N=3 validation) | Cite Approach 2 |
| 06_Quantum_Superposition | Partial constraint (Id + NC) | Scattered in notebooks | Build cleanly |
| 07_Measurement_Problem | Full constraint (Id + NC + EM) | Measurement framework | Build cleanly |

## Mapping: LRT Lean → Approach 2 Lean

| LRT Axiom | Justification | Approach 2 Equivalent | Axiom Count Reduction |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| `axiom IIS : Type*` | Information space exists | `InfiniteInformationSpace` | 18 → 1 (Foundations) |
| `axiom identity_constraint` | 3FLL: Identity | `InfoSpaceStructure.has_identity` | Absorb into 3FLL |
| `axiom non_contradiction` | 3FLL: Non-contradiction | `satisfies_non_contradiction` | Absorb into 3FLL |
| `axiom excluded_middle` | 3FLL: Excluded middle | `satisfies_excluded_middle` | Absorb into 3FLL |
| `axiom hilbert_space` | Operators need Hilbert space | Mathlib (import) | 0 (use Mathlib) |
| `axiom actualization` | A = L(I) principle | `Actualization` def | 0 (make it a def) |

**Target**: ~5-6 axioms total (IIS + 3FLL + minimal math structure)

**Everything else** becomes:
- **Definitions**: Operators (Π_id, {Π_i}, R), constraint hierarchy
- **Theorems**: Time emergence, energy measure, Born rule, measurement collapse
- **Imports**: Hilbert space from Mathlib, operator algebra from Mathlib

**Axiom count reduction**: 140 → ~5-6 (96% reduction)

## Lessons Learned (from Approach 2 → LRT)

### Axiom Management
- ❌ **Mistake**: Started with ~20 axioms, grew to 140
- ✅ **Lesson**: Start with ~5, prove everything else as theorems
- 🎯 **LRT Strategy**: Lean formalization AFTER paper and notebooks clarify what's truly axiomatic

### Notebook Scope
- ❌ **Mistake**: 25 notebooks covering many tangents
- ✅ **Lesson**: Focus on core derivations only
- 🎯 **LRT Strategy**: 9 notebooks = 5 core derivations + foundation + bridge to S_N

### Philosophical Clarity
- ❌ **Mistake**: Assumed 3FLL were obvious, focused on S_N math
- ✅ **Lesson**: Justify why logic (LRT Section 2), then show math
- 🎯 **LRT Strategy**: Philosophy first, then operator formalism, then S_N as example

### Nomenclature
- ❌ **Mistake**: "Information space" ambiguous (global IIS vs local subsystems)
- ✅ **Lesson**: Clear terms from day 1 (Session 15.0 fix)
- 🎯 **LRT Strategy**: IIS = global, subsystems = projections, no ambiguity

### Predictions
- ❌ **Mistake**: Emphasized finite-N (~10^-8, hard to test)
- ✅ **Lesson**: Lead with β ≠ 0 (near-term testable, device-independent)
- 🎯 **LRT Strategy**: β is PRIMARY prediction, finite-N is secondary

### Professional Tone
- ❌ **Mistake**: Some notebooks had informal thinking commentary
- ✅ **Lesson**: Professional from start (Session 14 cleanups)
- 🎯 **LRT Strategy**: Every notebook is publication-quality prose
