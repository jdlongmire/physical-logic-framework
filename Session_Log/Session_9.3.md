### Phase 2.2: Paper Abstracts and Introductions ✅ COMPLETE (Session 9.2)

**Logic_Field_Theory_I_Quantum_Probability.md** (updated):

1. **Abstract - Lean Status** (line 25):
   - OLD: "82% completion for core theorems"
   - NEW: "11 production modules with 0 active sorry statements (strategic axioms in measurement collapse documented with decoherence justification)"

2. **Abstract - Scope** (line 27):
   - OLD: Schrödinger equation "not yet derived... ~60% complete"
   - NEW: "Derives quantum probability structure (Born rule), Hamiltonian dynamics (H = D - A), and time evolution (Schrödinger equation from Fisher geodesics) in non-relativistic setting for distinguishable particles"

3. **Introduction - What's Derived** (lines 59-63):
   - Added: "What we successfully derive beyond Born rule"
   - Lists: Hamiltonian (H = D - A, 0 sorrys), Schrödinger (from Fisher geodesics, 0 sorrys), Interference (computational validation)

4. **Introduction - Limitations** (lines 65-75):
   - Primary gap: Indistinguishable particle statistics (Sprint 10 target)
   - Additional: Complete measurement collapse, QFT, Lorentz invariance

5. **Honest Assessment**: "Core non-relativistic QM for distinguishable particles derived. Indistinguishable particle statistics remains primary gap."

**Logic_Realism_Foundational_Paper.md** (reviewed):
- Already well-aligned with mission statement
- Correctly claims 0 sorry statements in core theorems
- Acknowledges measurement collapse and indistinguishable particles remain open
- No changes needed

**Commit**: f56cd37 "Sprint 9 Phase 2.2: Update Logic_Field_Theory_I paper with current status"

### Phase 2.3: RESEARCH_ROADMAP.md ✅ COMPLETE (Session 9.3)

Created comprehensive research roadmap (~6,400 words) integrating mission statement, scope, and strategic planning.

**Structure**:
- **Overview**: Mission recap, current status (Oct 2025), primary gaps
- **Near-Term** (Sprints 9-12, 3-6 months): Detailed sprint plans
  - Sprint 9: Mission alignment, documentation ✅
  - Sprint 10 (critical): Young diagrams → bosons/fermions OR documented failure
  - Sprint 11: Operator algebra, many-body systems, measurement refinement
  - Sprint 12: Paper revision, final integration, peer review response
- **Medium-Term** (6-12 months):
  - Experimental validation proposals (cold atoms, superconducting qubits)
  - QFT analog (second quantization from I = ∏ S_n)
  - Relativistic extensions (Lorentz invariance from OEIS A001892)
- **Long-Term** (1-3 years):
  - Year 1: Gravitational emergence (Einstein equations from strain dynamics)
  - Year 2: Standard Model structure (gauge fields from extended groups)
  - Year 3: Cosmological implications (arrow of time, inflation)
- **Resource Planning**: Personnel (postdocs, PhD students), funding targets ($3M over 3 years), infrastructure
- **Success Criteria & Contingencies**: Validation tiers, pivot points, honest assessment protocols

**Key Decision Points**:
- **Sprint 10**: Either framework extends to full QM (indistinguishable particles derived) OR remains distinguishable-particle sector (limitation documented)
- **Year 1-2**: Experimental validation (finite-N predictions confirmed) OR falsification (theory revision)
- **Year 2-3**: Broader extensions validated (QFT, relativity, gravity) OR scope limited to non-relativistic QM

**Guiding Principles**:
1. Honest assessment first (failures documented rigorously)
2. Falsifiability always (clear criteria)
3. Progressive refinement (build on validated results)
4. Team consultation (quality >0.70)
5. Publish null results
6. Mission focus (derive QM from logic; extensions secondary)
7. Resource realism (ambitious but feasible)

**Milestones Table**: 10 key milestones from Nov 2025 to Dec 2029

**Commit**: 5fa9146 "Sprint 9 Phase 2.3 Complete: RESEARCH_ROADMAP.md created"
