**Session 5.1 Status**: ✅✅✅✅✅✅ SIX PHASES COMPLETE - SPRINTS 1-2 DONE

**To Resume Next Session**:
1. ✅ Read: Session_Log/Session_0.0.md (master status) OR latest Session_X.Y.md
2. ✅ Read: Session_Log/Session_5.1.md (this file - for context)
3. ✅ Review: notebooks/Logic_Realism/README.md (Sprint 3 notebook descriptions)
4. ✅ Review: notebooks/Logic_Realism/V2_REFACTORING_PLAN.md (V2 template structure)
5. Begin: Notebook 06 (Interferometry and Mach-Zehnder)

**V2 Workflow** (established standard):
1. Create notebook with standardized header (copyright, license, citation)
2. Introduction section (purpose, key theorem, validation approach)
3. Complete mathematical derivations (~2,000-4,500 words LaTeX)
4. Setup cell with all helper functions inlined (self-contained)
5. Computational implementation sections
6. Comprehensive validation summary with assertions
7. Conclusion with Lean proof reference
8. Git add + commit with detailed message
9. Git push to remote (GitHub backup)
10. **Update session log progressively** (new protocol)
11. V&V approval from user before next notebook

**Quality Standards** (maintain for all future notebooks):
- ✅ Self-contained (no external .py dependencies)
- ✅ Complete mathematical proofs embedded
- ✅ Validation Triangle (Math → Code → Lean)
- ✅ Publication-quality figures (300 DPI PNG + SVG)
- ✅ Programmatic validation with assertions
- ✅ Professional metadata (copyright, license, citation)
- ✅ Commit and push after each notebook completion

**Mathematical Progress**:
- ✅ Foundation established (S_N, V_K, K(N)=N-2)
- ✅ Born rule derived (MaxEnt principle)
- ✅ Fisher-Fubini-Study equivalence proven
- ✅ Lagrangian-Hamiltonian duality established
- ✅ Graph Laplacian structure verified
- ➡️ Next: Physical systems (interferometry, qubits, energy levels)

**Path to Schrödinger Equation**:
1. ✅ Born rule P(σ) = |a_σ|² (Notebook 03)
2. ✅ Hamiltonian Ĥ = D - A (Notebook 05)
3. ➡️ Time evolution operator Û(t) = e^(-iĤt/ℏ) (Notebook 06-07)
4. ➡️ Schrödinger equation iℏ∂_t|ψ⟩ = Ĥ|ψ⟩ (Sprint 4)
