# Session 7.1 - Sprint 7 Setup: Measurement Theory + Lean Remediation

**Session Number**: 7.1
**Started**: October 10, 2025
**Focus**: Sprint 7 planning and initialization

---

## Session Overview

**Context**: Session 7.0 completed critical Lean proof remediation (MaximumEntropy fixed, GraphLaplacian completed). Now transitioning to Sprint 7, which combines measurement theory development (from master sprint plan) with continued Lean proof remediation.

**Session 7.1 Purpose**: Set up Sprint 7 folder structure, tracking documents, and integration plan for dual-track development.

---

## Sprint 7 Overview

### Dual-Track Approach

**Track 1: Measurement Theory** (from SPRINT_PLAN_ENHANCED_TEAM_INTEGRATION.md)
- **Objective**: Address Peer Review Issue #2 (Measurement & Wave Function Collapse)
- **Deliverables**:
  - Notebook 14: Measurement Mechanism (~5,000 words)
  - Notebook 15: Observer Decoherence (~4,000 words)
  - Notebook 16: Toy Model Measurement (~3,000 words)
  - MeasurementMechanism.lean (~500 lines, 0 sorry)
- **Team Budget**: 15 consultations over 2 weeks

**Track 2: Lean Remediation** (continuing from Session 7.0)
- **Objective**: Complete high-priority modules to unlock dependent code
- **Targets**:
  - InformationSpace.lean (2 sorry) → unlock MaximumEntropy
  - TheoremD1.lean (1 sorry) → major theoretical milestone
  - ConstraintAccumulation.lean (9 sorry) → progress toward unlocking QuantumCore
  - Operator.lean (6 sorry) → if time permits
- **Goal**: Reduce total sorry count from 101 to <90

## Sprint 7 Key Features

### Integration Strategy

**Measurement Theory ↔ Lean Remediation**:
- Morning: Measurement notebook development
- Midday: Team consultations (alternating between tracks)
- Afternoon: Lean work (alternating between MeasurementMechanism.lean and remediation)
- Evening: Integration, documentation, commits

**Cross-Track Benefits**:
- InformationSpace completion strengthens measurement theory foundation
- TheoremD1 completion connects three derivation paths (supports measurement)
- MeasurementMechanism.lean provides formal proof framework
- Remediation progress enables future quantum dynamics work

### Team Consultation Strategy

**15 Total Consultations**:
- 5 for measurement theory development
- 4 for Lean formalization (measurement)
- 4 for Lean remediation guidance
- 1 for integration check
- 1 for comprehensive sprint review

**Quality Threshold**: >0.70 average (per sprint success metrics)

## Current Lean Status (Baseline for Sprint 7)

**From Session 7.0 (verified October 10, 2025)**:

**Production-Ready** (0 sorry + builds + no incomplete dependencies): **5 modules**
1. BornRuleNonCircularity.lean
2. ConstraintThreshold.lean
3. ThreeFundamentalLaws.lean
4. ConvergenceTheorem.lean
5. FisherGeometry.lean

**Complete but with dependencies**: **2 modules**
- MaximumEntropy.lean (depends on InformationSpace - 2 sorry)
- QuantumCore.lean (depends on ConstraintAccumulation - 9 sorry)

**Incomplete**: **6 modules, 101 sorry total**
- InformationSpace.lean: 2 sorry (Priority 1 for Sprint 7)
- ConstraintAccumulation.lean: 9 sorry (Priority 2)
- Operator.lean: 6 sorry
- TheoremD1.lean: 1 sorry (Priority 3)
- BornRule.lean: 18 sorry
- HilbertSpace.lean: 59 sorry
- BellInequality_Fixed.lean: 6 sorry

## Next Steps

**To begin Sprint 7 work, choose**:

**Option A: Start with Measurement Theory**
1. Read relevant literature on quantum measurement
2. Plan Notebook 14 structure (measurement mechanism)
3. Team Consultation 1: Measurement models in quantum foundations
4. Begin implementing constraint-addition model

**Option B: Start with Lean Remediation**
1. Read InformationSpace.lean (lines 295, 320 with sorry)
2. Analyze what's needed to complete proofs
3. Team Consultation 1: InformationSpace remediation guidance
4. Complete proofs and verify build

**Option C: Run Auditor Checklist First**
1. Execute Program Auditor Agent quick audit
2. Verify current sorry counts
3. Confirm build statuses
4. Update understanding with latest verified statistics
5. Then proceed with Option A or B

**Recommendation**: Option C (run auditor) then Option B (InformationSpace - quick win to build momentum)
