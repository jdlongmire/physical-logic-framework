### Critical Reviewer Quotes

**Grok (0.84/1.0)**:
> "The most pressing issue is the potential circularity in the derivation of the Born Rule (Theorem 5.1). The reliance on unitary invariance and other quantum-like assumptions suggests that the framework may not be deriving quantum mechanics from truly independent first principles."

**Gemini (0.58/1.0)**:
> "The most critical concern is the potential for circularity in the derivation of the Born rule. Carefully examine the assumptions used in the derivation to ensure that they do not implicitly assume the Born rule or any equivalent principle."

**ChatGPT (0.52/1.0)**:
> "The model seems to require a large number of assumptions, some of which are not well motivated... it's not clear why [K(N)=N-2] should be the case."
