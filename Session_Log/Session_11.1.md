# Session 11.1 - Sprint 11: Boson/Fermion Distinction from Algebraic Structure

**Session Number**: 11.1
**Started**: 2025-10-14
**Focus**: Sprint 11 implementation (Lean formalization track)
**Sprint**: 11 (Boson/Fermion Distinction)

---

## Session Overview

**Context**: Sprint 10 complete (derived symmetrization postulate from 3FLL + epistemic constraints).

**Sprint 11 Goal**: Extend to boson/fermion distinction - why symmetric vs antisymmetric?

**Key Challenge**: Can we derive the spin-statistics connection from 3FLL + algebraic structure, or must we accept spin as additional input?

**Session Goals**:
1. Plan Sprint 11 scope and approach
2. Create tracking documents
3. Initial team consultation on feasibility
4. Decision: Ambitious (derive algebra from 3FLL) vs pragmatic (accept spin as input)

---

## Sprint 10 Recap (Foundation for Sprint 11)

### What Sprint 10 Accomplished

**Theorem Proved** (EpistemicStates.lean):
```lean
theorem symmetrization_from_epistemic_consistency :
  IndistinguishableParticles →
  ∀ (s : SymmetryType),
    WellDefinedProp (symmetric_proposition s) →
    (s = SymmetryType.Symmetric ∨ s = SymmetryType.Antisymmetric)
```

**Result**: Only symmetric OR antisymmetric states are well-defined for indistinguishable particles.

**Key Insight**: Indistinguishability is epistemic (information limit), not ontic (particle property). Mixed-symmetry states require inaccessible labels → ill-defined.

**Significance**: Reduced QM axiomatic basis (symmetrization postulate → theorem)

### What Sprint 10 Deferred

**Boson/Fermion Distinction**: Why symmetric (bosons) vs antisymmetric (fermions)?

**Standard Answer** (Spin-Statistics Theorem):
- Integer spin (0, 1, 2, ...) → Bosons (symmetric)
- Half-integer spin (1/2, 3/2, ...) → Fermions (antisymmetric)
- Pauli (1940): Derived from relativistic QFT

**Sprint 11 Challenge**: Can PLF derive this without relativity?

---

## Sprint 11 Scope and Approach

### The Core Question

**Primary**: Can 3FLL + algebraic structure determine commutation vs anticommutation?

**Hypothesis**: Well-defined propositions for indistinguishable particles require pure operator algebras (either commutation OR anticommutation, not mixed).

**Connection**:
- Commutation algebra → Symmetric states (bosons)
- Anticommutation algebra → Antisymmetric states (fermions)

### Three Approach Options

**Option A - Pragmatic** (Accept Spin as Input):
- Postulate: Half-integer spin → antisymmetric, Integer spin → symmetric
- Focus: Connect spin to algebraic structure
- Advantage: Achievable, honest scope
- Limitation: Doesn't fully derive spin-statistics

**Option B - Ambitious** (Algebraic Derivation):
- Derive: 3FLL + consistency → commutation vs anticommutation
- Explore: Why two distinct algebras?
- Advantage: Deeper reduction of QM postulates
- Limitation: May not be achievable

**Option C - Topological**:
- Use: 3D space topology + exchange paths
- Derive: Phase factors from geometry
- Advantage: Non-relativistic, geometric
- Limitation: Requires spatial structure (beyond current PLF)

**Sprint 10 Team Recommendation**: Start with Option B (algebraic), fall back to Option A if needed.

### Proposed Derivation Strategy (Option B)

**Step 1**: Define creation/annihilation operators in PLF framework
- Connect to constraint operators from Sprint 9
- Epistemic interpretation

**Step 2**: Derive operator algebra from 3FLL + well-definedness
- Mixed algebras → ill-defined propositions
- Only pure algebras (commutation OR anticommutation) consistent

**Step 3**: Connect algebra to symmetry type
- Commutation → symmetric wavefunctions (proof)
- Anticommutation → antisymmetric wavefunctions (proof)

**Step 4**: Assess spin connection
- If achievable: Derive spin from algebra
- If not: Document honest scope

## Research Questions

### Primary Questions

1. Can 3FLL alone determine commutation vs anticommutation?
2. What is the minimal additional input required?
3. Is spin-statistics derivable non-relativistically?

### Secondary Questions

4. How do Young diagrams connect to operator algebras?
5. What role does dimensionality (3D) play?
6. Can we derive Pauli exclusion from 3FLL?

### Philosophical Questions

7. Is spin ontological or epistemic?
8. Why two types of statistics (not more)?
9. Connection to measurement/consciousness?

## Phase 1: Lean Formalization - AlgebraicStructure.lean

### Accomplishments

**Created**: `AlgebraicStructure.lean` (355 lines, builds successfully)

**Operator Algebras Formalized**:
1. **AlgebraType** inductive: Commutation (bosonic) vs Anticommutation (fermionic)
2. **CreationOp** and **AnnihilationOp**: Abstract operator types
3. **Commutator** and **Anticommutator**: Operator products
4. **Bosonic CCR**: `[a_i, a_dag_j] = δᵢⱼ` (canonical commutation relations)
5. **Fermionic CAR**: `{b_i, b_dag_j} = δᵢⱼ` (canonical anticommutation relations)
6. **Pauli Exclusion**: Axiom for fermionic double creation = 0

**Key Definitions**:
- `algebra_to_symmetry`: Maps AlgebraType → SymmetryType (Sprint 10 bridge)
  - Commutation → Symmetric (bosons)
  - Anticommutation → Antisymmetric (fermions)

**Key Theorems**:
- `algebraic_purity_from_epistemic_consistency`: Main theorem (1 sorry)
  - Goal: Prove 3FLL + indistinguishability → pure algebras only
  - Status: Proof strategy outlined, sorry deferred

**Key Axioms**:
- `mixed_algebra_inconsistent`: Hypothesis that mixed algebras create ill-defined propositions
- `statistics_from_algebra`: Bose-Einstein vs Fermi-Dirac from algebra type
- `spin_statistics_postulate`: Spin → statistics (postulated, not derived in PLF)

**Build Status**: ✅ Builds successfully (`lake build`)
**Sorry Count**: 1 (algebraic_purity theorem)

**Integration**:
- Imports: `EpistemicStates.lean` (Sprint 10 foundation)
- Namespace: `PhysicalLogicFramework.Indistinguishability`
- Uses: `SymmetryType` from Sprint 10, connects algebra to symmetry

### Technical Challenges Resolved

1. **Unicode in identifiers**: Lean doesn't support `†` or subscripts in variable names
   - Fixed: `a†ⱼ` → `a_dag_j`, `bᵢ` → `b_i`

2. **Decidable equality for if-then-else**: `if i = j` requires `DecidableEq α`
   - Fixed: Added `[DecidableEq α]` constraint to CCR/CAR axioms

3. **Axiom return types**: `spin_statistics_postulate` needed proper type signature
   - Fixed: Changed from returning value to returning Prop
