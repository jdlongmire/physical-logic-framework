**Major achievements**:
- ✅ MaximumEntropy.lean: 0 sorrys (all theorems proven)
- ✅ Peer review analysis: Fair assessment, actionable response plan
- ✅ 6-sprint response plan: Ready for Sprint 1 execution

3. Proven: uniform_maximizes_entropy (via Gibbs' inequality)
4. Proven: uniform_unique_maxent (uniqueness of maximum entropy)
5. Proven: amplitude_distribution_from_maxent (MaxEnt → uniform Born rule)

## Phase 2: Peer Review Analysis

### Accomplishments
1. Analyzed peer review report in detail
2. Assessed fairness: FAIR and constructive
3. Identified 5 major concerns (all actionable)
4. Distinguished "demonstrated elegance" vs "proven necessity" gap
5. Inventoried assets for response (proofs, Lean modules, data, figures)

### Peer Review Summary
**Verdict**: Accept with Major Revisions ✅
**Ratings**: Originality 5/5, Technical Soundness 4/5, Impact 4/5

**Strengths recognized**:
- Novel permutation-logic bridge

     - Proof via reversal bijection φ: L_N → H_N
     - Lemma A.1: Inversion complement formula h(φ(σ)) = max_inv - h(σ)

   - Added new section after "Worked Example: N=3" (Section 2.2, line ~256)
   - Title: "Metric Uniqueness: Quantitative Comparison"
   - Compared 4 candidate metrics:
     1. Inversion count h(σ)
     2. Spearman footrule F(σ)
     3. Cayley distance C(σ)
     4. Ulam distance U(σ)
   - Tested against 7 criteria:
     1. Logical interpretation (EM violations)
     2. Mahonian symmetry (|V_K| = |H_N|)
     3. Coxeter word length (ℓ(σ))
     4. Born rule match (N=3, K=1)
     5. Kendall tau standard
     6. Sorting complexity (bubble sort)
     7. Information theory (MDL encoding)
   - **Results Table**: Inversions pass 7/7, Footrule 0/7, Cayley 2/7, Ulam 0/7
   - Detailed verification for N=4, K=2 showing only inversions yield |V_2| = 9 with correct symmetry
   - **Result**: Demonstrates inversion count is multiply-determined mathematical necessity
   - **Addresses**: Peer Review Major Concern #1 (Why inversions vs alternatives?)

2. **Task 2: Scope of Quantum Derivation** ✅
   - Added comprehensive Section 3.6 after Section 3.5 (before Section 4)
   - 4 subsections:
     - 3.6.1: Derived Components (6 items: uniform Born rule, Hilbert space, orthogonality, superposition, interference, K=N-2)
     - 3.6.2: Assumed Components (complex phases ℂ, MaxEnt principle)
     - 3.6.3: Beyond Current Scope (general states, time evolution, measurement, observables)
     - 3.6.4: Summary Table (11 components categorized)
   - **Honest Assessment**: "derives static Born rule probabilities for uniform ground states" not "complete QM derivation"
   - **Forward Path**: Dynamics = 12-18 months research, moderate-to-high risk
   - **Result**: Crystal clear scope boundaries, prevents overclaiming
   - **Addresses**: Peer Review Major Concern #3 (Quantum bridge scope) & #5 (Overreach claims)

3. **Task 3: Complex Phases Assumption - Prominent Callout** ✅
   - Enhanced Section 3.6.2 with boxed warning
   - Format: "⚠️ CRITICAL ASSUMPTION: COMPLEX AMPLITUDES ⚠️"
   - Clear distinction:
     - What we derive: Phase degrees of freedom needed for interference
     - What we do NOT derive: That ℂ specifically (vs ℍ, 𝕆, or geometric phases)
   - Justification for ℂ: Minimal extension, empirically validated, mathematically elegant
   - Status: "INPUT to our axioms, not OUTPUT of our derivations"
   - Speculative path: U(1) gauge symmetry on permutohedron (future work)
   - **Result**: No ambiguity that complex numbers are assumed, not derived
   - **Addresses**: Peer Review Major Concern #5 (Distinguish derived vs assumed)

### Files Modified
- `paper/Logic_Field_Theory_I_Quantum_Probability.md` (+140 lines)
  - Metric comparison section (~55 lines)
  - Section 3.6 scope clarification (~100 lines including 4 subsections)
