# Physical Logic Framework: Research Roadmap

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: October 11, 2025
**Purpose**: Strategic research planning aligned with mission statement and scope

---

## Overview

This roadmap integrates the Physical Logic Framework mission (deriving quantum mechanics from logical constraints on information) with realistic timelines, resource constraints, and honest assessment of technical challenges. Plans are organized by time horizon with specific deliverables, success metrics, and contingency paths.

**Mission Recap**: Replace the five postulates of quantum mechanics (state space, observables, Born rule, dynamics, measurement) with one necessary axiom (Three Fundamental Laws of Logic) and one existential postulate (Infinite Information Space I = ‚àè S_n), deriving quantum structure from A = L(I).

**Current Status** (October 2025):
- **Derived**: Born rule, Hamiltonian (H = D - A), Schr√∂dinger equation, interference, energy quantization
- **Formalized**: 11 Lean modules, 0 active sorry statements (strategic axioms justified in measurement mechanism)
- **Validated**: 18 notebooks (~65,000 words), 100% computational validation
- **Primary Gap**: Indistinguishable particle statistics (bosons/fermions)
- **Scope**: Non-relativistic quantum mechanics for distinguishable particles

## Near-Term (Sprints 9-12, 3-6 Months)

### Sprint 10: Exchange Statistics from Young Diagrams (Critical)

**Duration**: 3-4 weeks (November 2025)

**Objective**: Resolve the indistinguishable particle gap via representation-theoretic analysis.

**Hypothesis**: The Logical Field L projects S_N Hilbert space onto symmetric ‚äï antisymmetric irreducible representations, eliminating mixed-symmetry Young diagrams as logically contradictory.

**Research Questions**:
1. Which 3FLL is violated by mixed-symmetry states? (Non-Contradiction, Identity, or Excluded Middle?)
2. Does V_K = {œÉ : h(œÉ) ‚â§ N-2} naturally project onto symmetric ‚äï antisymmetric subspace?
3. How does inversion count h(œÉ) relate to Young tableau structure?
4. Can Pauli exclusion principle and spin-statistics theorem be derived from logical constraints?

**Deliverables**:
- **Notebook 18**: Exchange Statistics from Young Diagrams (~8,000 words)
  - Young diagram enumeration for S_3, S_4, S_5
  - Projection analysis: which irreps satisfy h(œÉ) ‚â§ N-2?
  - Computational test: fermionic vs. bosonic behavior in toy models
- **Lean Module**: `ExchangeStatistics.lean` (target: 0 sorrys or strategic axioms with roadmap)
- **Team Consultation**: Young diagram filtering hypothesis (3 LLMs, quality >0.70)
- **Decision Report**: Either validation (major breakthrough) or documented failure (honest limitation)

**Success Metrics**:
- **If validated**: Bosons = symmetric irrep [N], fermions = antisymmetric irrep [1^N] derived from 3FLL
  - Spin-statistics theorem becomes corollary
  - Framework extends to full quantum mechanics (distinguishable + indistinguishable)
  - Publish breakthrough paper in *Physical Review Letters* or *Nature Physics*
- **If refuted**: Document failure honestly in SCOPE_AND_LIMITATIONS.md
  - Keep indistinguishable particles as acknowledged limitation
  - Framework remains valid for distinguishable particle sector
  - Pivot to complementary research directions (many-body, QFT analog)

**Contingency**: If inconclusive after 4 weeks, table hypothesis and proceed to Sprint 11 with documented "open problem" status.

---

### Phase 2: Quantum Field Theory Analog (Months 7-12)

**Research Questions**:
- Do creation/annihilation operators emerge from S_N ‚Üí S_{N¬±1} transitions?

## Long-Term (1-3 Years)

### Year 1: Gravitational Emergence

**Objective**: Derive Einstein field equations from strain dynamics on information manifold.

**Hypothesis**: Metric perturbations g_ŒºŒΩ = Œ∑_ŒºŒΩ + h_ŒºŒΩ correspond to logical strain on permutohedron, with wave equation ‚àÇ¬≤h/‚àÇt¬≤ ~ Laplacian operator.

**Milestones**:
- **Month 12-15**: Strain dynamics formalism (metric perturbations from h(œÉ) field)
- **Month 15-18**: Einstein equations from consistency of constraint evolution
- **Month 18-24**: Gravitational wave solutions, Schwarzschild metric in discrete limit
- **Month 24-36**: Quantum gravity analog (graviton as permutohedron excitation?)

**Deliverables**:
- *Logic Field Theory III: Gravitational Emergence* paper
- Lean formalization: `GravitationalDynamics.lean` module
- If successful: Unified quantum-gravity framework ‚Üí Nobel Prize candidacy

**Risk**: Highly speculative. Failure mode: gravity remains emergent phenomenon, not derivable from 3FLL.

---

### Year 2: Standard Model Structure

**Objective**: Investigate gauge symmetries (electromagnetic, weak, strong forces) from logical constraints on extended information spaces.

**Hypothesis**: Larger groups (SU(2), SU(3)) beyond S_N may emerge from multi-level constraint hierarchies.

**Approach**:
- **Gauge fields**: Extend S_N to wreath products, semidirect products with U(1), SU(2), SU(3)
- **Particle spectrum**: Quarks, leptons as irreducible representations of extended symmetry group
- **Interaction vertices**: Constraint transitions enforce gauge couplings

**Deliverables**:
- Exploratory notebooks (Gauge Fields, Particle Spectrum, Interaction Vertices)
- If promising: *Logic Field Theory IV: Standard Model from Logic* paper
- If unsuccessful: Document as out-of-scope, limit framework to quantum mechanics + gravity

---

### Year 3: Cosmological Implications

**Objective**: Apply Logic Realism to cosmology (initial conditions, arrow of time, inflation).

**Research Questions**:
- Does low-entropy initial state (Big Bang) correspond to low h(œÉ) constraint?
- Is cosmological arrow of time the manifestation of global L-flow (h decreasing monotonically)?
- Can inflation be modeled as rapid constraint relaxation in early universe?

**Approach**:
- **Notebook series**: Cosmological Applications (initial conditions, arrow of time, inflation analog)
- **Collaboration**: Partner with cosmology groups for observational predictions
- **Lean formalization**: If rigorous derivations emerge

**Deliverables**:
- *Logic Field Theory V: Cosmological Foundations* paper (if validated)
- Testable predictions: CMB anomalies, primordial power spectrum deviations
- If successful: Unified framework (QM + gravity + cosmology)

## Success Criteria and Contingencies

### Framework Validation Tiers

**Tier 1: Core Validation** (Sprints 9-12, 6 months)
- ‚úÖ Born rule, Hamiltonian, Schr√∂dinger equation derived
- ‚è≥ Indistinguishable particles resolved OR documented as limitation
- ‚è≥ Measurement mechanism formalized (reduce strategic axioms to ‚â§5)
- **Outcome**: Framework either extends to full QM OR remains valid for distinguishable sector

**Tier 2: Experimental Validation** (Year 1-2)
- Finite-N predictions tested in 2+ experimental platforms
- At least 1 experimental signature confirmed (or falsified ‚Üí revise theory)
- Precision targets achieved: ~10^{-8} interferometric sensitivity

**Tier 3: Broader Extensions** (Year 2-3)
- At least 1 of: QFT analog, relativistic extension, or gravitational emergence validated
- If all fail: Document framework scope as "non-relativistic quantum mechanics only"

### Pivot Points

**If Sprint 10 (Young Diagrams) Fails**:
- Accept indistinguishable particles as limitation
- Focus on distinguishable-particle applications (interferometry, path integrals, quantum computing with labeled qubits)
- Publish honest assessment: "Logic Realism derives quantum structure for distinguishable systems"

**If Experimental Tests Falsify Predictions** (Year 1-2):
- Identify which assumption fails (K(N) = N-2, permutation symmetry, or constraint mechanism)
- Revise framework OR conclude Logic Realism falsified
- Publish null results with scientific integrity

**If Long-Term Extensions All Fail** (Year 3):
- Framework remains "first-principles derivation of non-relativistic QM for distinguishable particles"
- Still significant: reduces 5 QM postulates to 2 axioms + MaxEnt
- Continue as specialized research program, not Theory of Everything

## Guiding Principles

1. **Honest Assessment First**: Document failures as rigorously as successes
2. **Falsifiability Always**: Every hypothesis must have clear falsification criteria
3. **Progressive Refinement**: Build on validated results, pivot from failed hypotheses
4. **Team Consultation**: Multi-LLM quality scores >0.70 for major decisions
5. **Publish Null Results**: Negative findings advance science; document them prominently
6. **Mission Focus**: Derive quantum structure from logic; extensions are secondary
7. **Resource Realism**: Ambitious goals, but grounded in feasible timelines and budgets
