# Lean Proof Remediation Sprint Plan

**Created**: October 10, 2025 (Post-Session 7.0)
**Purpose**: Systematic elimination of remaining 101 sorry statements across 6 incomplete modules
**Timeline**: 6 focused sprints (12 weeks) running parallel to notebook formalization sprints

---

## Current Status (Session 7.0 Baseline)

### Production-Ready Modules (5)
✅ **No dependencies with sorry statements**:
1. BornRuleNonCircularity.lean (0 sorry)
2. ConstraintThreshold.lean (0 sorry)
3. ThreeFundamentalLaws.lean (0 sorry)
4. ConvergenceTheorem.lean (0 sorry)
5. FisherGeometry.lean (0 sorry)

### Complete but Blocked (2)
⚠️ **0 sorry but incomplete dependencies**:
6. MaximumEntropy.lean (depends on InformationSpace - 2 sorry)
7. QuantumCore.lean (depends on ConstraintAccumulation - 9 sorry)

### Incomplete Modules (6)
❌ **Total: 101 sorry statements**:
- InformationSpace.lean: 2 sorry (HIGH PRIORITY - blocks MaximumEntropy)
- ConstraintAccumulation.lean: 9 sorry (HIGH PRIORITY - blocks QuantumCore)
- Operator.lean: 6 sorry (MEDIUM PRIORITY - standalone)
- TheoremD1.lean: 1 sorry (LOW PRIORITY - standalone)
- BornRule.lean: 18 sorry (LOW PRIORITY - complex, exploratory)
- HilbertSpace.lean: 59 sorry (DEFERRED - highly complex, experimental)
- BellInequality_Fixed.lean: 6 sorry (LOW PRIORITY - validation module)

**Target**: Reduce to 0 sorry in priority modules (InformationSpace, ConstraintAccumulation, Operator, TheoremD1)

---

## Strategic Approach

### Phase 1: Unlock Blocked Modules (Sprints R1-R2)
**Goal**: Complete InformationSpace and ConstraintAccumulation to unlock MaximumEntropy and QuantumCore
**Impact**: +2 production-ready modules (7 total)
**Timeline**: 4 weeks

### Phase 2: Complete Standalone Modules (Sprints R3-R4)
**Goal**: Eliminate sorry from Operator and TheoremD1
**Impact**: +2 production-ready modules (9 total)
**Timeline**: 4 weeks

### Phase 3: Advanced Modules (Sprints R5-R6)
**Goal**: Reduce sorry count in BornRule and BellInequality_Fixed
**Impact**: Improved quantum foundations coverage
**Timeline**: 4 weeks

### Phase 4: Defer Complex Experimental Work
**Decision**: HilbertSpace.lean (59 sorry) deferred to post-program research
**Rationale**: Highly experimental, not blocking other work, requires deep Hilbert space formalization

---

## Sprint R1: InformationSpace.lean (2 sorry)

**Duration**: Week 1-2
**Focus**: Complete foundational information space module

   - **Strategy**: Use Mathlib's `Fintype.card_prod` theorem
   - **Difficulty**: LOW (standard Mathlib result)
   - **Time estimate**: 1-2 hours

2. **Line 320**: Physical theory specification
   - **Context**: Detailed construction requiring physical theory specification

## Integration with Existing Sprint Plan

### Parallel Execution Strategy

**Sprints 7-10** (Notebook formalization): Continue as planned
**Sprints R1-R6** (Lean remediation): Run in parallel with focused time allocation

**Time Allocation per Week**:
- Notebook work: 60% (3-4 days)
- Lean remediation: 40% (2-3 days)

**Team Consultation Budget**:
- Existing plan: 53 consultations remaining for Sprints 7-10
- Remediation: 8 additional consultations (1-2 per sprint)
- **Total**: 61 consultations (within budget)

### Weekly Schedule Example (Sprints 7 + R1-R2)

**Week 1** (Sprint 7 + R1):
- Mon-Tue: Notebook 06 development
- Wed: InformationSpace.lean (sorry 1)
- Thu: InformationSpace.lean (sorry 2)
- Fri: Team consultation (notebook + Lean review)
- Weekend: Integration and documentation

**Week 2** (Sprint 7 + R1):
- Mon-Tue: Lean module for Notebook 06
- Wed: InformationSpace.lean verification + MaximumEntropy validation
- Thu-Fri: Notebook 06 refinement
- Weekend: Sprint R1 completion, prepare R2

### Success Metrics (End of 12 Weeks)

**Target Outcomes**:
- Production-ready modules: 9 (up from 5)
  - Current 5: BornRuleNonCircularity, ConstraintThreshold, ThreeFundamentalLaws, ConvergenceTheorem, FisherGeometry
  - +2 from R1-R2: MaximumEntropy, QuantumCore
  - +2 from R3-R4: Operator, TheoremD1
- Total sorry: <20 (from 101)
  - R1: -2 (InformationSpace)
  - R2: -9 (ConstraintAccumulation)
  - R3: -6 (Operator)
  - R4: -1 (TheoremD1)
  - R5: -13 target (BornRule 18 → 5)
  - R6: -6 target (BellInequality_Fixed)
  - Deferred: 59 (HilbertSpace)
  - **Net: 101 - 37 = 64, minus HilbertSpace defer = 5 remaining**

**Revised Target**: 9 production-ready modules, <10 sorry in active modules (excluding HilbertSpace)

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Proofs More Complex Than Expected
**Mitigation**:
- Team consultations for strategic guidance
- Option to axiomatize with proper justification
- Adjust timeline if needed (extend sprint by 1 week)

### Risk 2: Dependency Issues
**Mitigation**:
- Verify builds after each sorry elimination
- Dependency chain checks built into process
- Regular integration testing

### Risk 3: Time Constraints
**Mitigation**:
- Parallel execution with notebook work
- Prioritization (focus on unlocking blocked modules)
- Defer low-priority modules if needed

### Risk 4: Mathematical Complexity
**Mitigation**:
- Team consultations with formal verification experts
- Mathlib community consultation (Lean Zulip)
- Strategic axiomatization as fallback

## Program Auditor Agent Integration

### Critical Validation Protocol

The **Program Auditor Agent** (see `Program_Auditor_Agent.md`) serves as the final arbiter of all completion claims. Every sprint MUST pass auditor review before being marked complete.

### Audit Execution After Each Sprint

**Step 1: Lean Code Inventory**
```bash
# Count sorry statements
grep -c sorry lean/LFT_Proofs/PhysicalLogicFramework/[Module].lean

# Verify builds
cd lean && lake build PhysicalLogicFramework.[Module]

# Check dependencies
grep "^import" lean/LFT_Proofs/PhysicalLogicFramework/[Module].lean
# Then grep each dependency for sorry
```

**Step 2: Cross-Validation Matrix**
- List all major claims in sprint's Lean module
- Find corresponding computational notebook validation
- Document any disconnects (Lean proves X but notebook shows Y)
- Flag any notebook results without Lean proofs

**Step 3: Axiom Justification Review**
- List all axioms introduced in sprint
- Classify: Empirical fact / Mathematical standard / Novel assumption
- Require justification + citation for all novel axioms
- Flag any "disguised sorry" (axiom for unproven mathematical result)

**Step 4: Generate Audit Report**
Format:
```markdown
## AUDIT REPORT: Sprint RX
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

### Major Problems and Inconsistencies
[List any critical issues found - MUST start with this section]

### Quantitative Assessment
- Module sorry count: X (before) → Y (after)
- Build status: [PASS/FAIL with errors]
- Axioms introduced: Z (empirical: A, standard: B, novel: C)
- Cross-validation: M claims validated, N disconnects found

### Auditor Verdict
[APPROVED / REVISIONS REQUIRED]

### Required Corrections
[Specific actions needed if revisions required]
```

**Step 5: Documentation Update**
- ONLY update statistics if auditor approves
- Include auditor report reference in sprint tracking
- Flag any overclaiming language for removal

### Red Flag Triggers

The auditor will REJECT sprint completion if:
- ❌ Any claim of "complete" without verified 0 sorry + successful build
- ❌ Dependency has sorry statements (not truly independent)
- ❌ Notebook-Lean disconnect (math doesn't match reality)
- ❌ Novel axiom without proper justification
- ❌ Statistics don't match grep/build results
- ❌ Hype language ("historic," "breakthrough") without factual basis

### Auditor Success Criteria

Sprint is APPROVED only if:
- ✅ All claims verifiable via grep/build commands
- ✅ Sorry count matches actual grep results
- ✅ No hype language; quantified progress only
- ✅ Lean proofs match computational results
- ✅ Novel axioms properly justified
- ✅ No "Major Problems" identified

### Final Program Audit (Week 12)

**Comprehensive Validation**:
1. Re-run full audit checklist across ALL modules
2. Generate complete cross-validation matrix (all Lean theorems ↔ all notebooks)
3. Produce final "Major Problems" list for entire codebase
4. Assess: "Is this physics or mathematics?"
5. Identify untestable/unfalsifiable assumptions
6. List concrete experimental predictions (if any)

**Output**: `FINAL_PROGRAM_AUDIT_REPORT.md`

**Decision Point**:
- If major problems remain: Document honestly, do NOT claim "complete"
- If audit passes: May proceed with publication claims (within auditor-approved bounds)
