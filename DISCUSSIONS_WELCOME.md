## 👋 Welcome to Physical Logic Framework Discussions!

We're exploring one of the most fundamental questions in physics: **Can quantum mechanics be derived from pure logic?**

This repository contains formal proofs (Lean 4), computational validation (Jupyter notebooks), and peer-reviewed research showing that quantum probabilities, unitarity, and dynamics emerge from combinatorics and information theory—with **zero quantum assumptions**.

We're using Discussions as a place to connect with researchers, collaborators, and anyone interested in:

### 🔬 **Research Topics**
- **Foundations of Quantum Mechanics**: Non-circular derivations, experimental predictions
- **Formal Verification**: Lean 4 theorem proving, dependency checking, proof strategies
- **Information Theory → Physics**: MaxEnt, Fisher information, entropy constraints
- **AI-Assisted Research**: Multi-LLM validation, human-AI collaboration, research acceleration
- **Experimental Physics**: Testing finite-N quantum corrections, multi-slit interferometry

### 💡 **How to Participate**

**Ask Questions**:
- Curious about the derivation chain? Ask about specific theorems
- Want to understand the Lean proofs? We'll walk through them
- Interested in experimental predictions? Discuss feasibility and protocols

**Share Ideas**:
- Extensions to the framework (gauge fields, QFT, gravity)
- Alternative proof strategies for Lean formalization
- Novel experimental tests or signatures
- Applications of the AI-assisted methodology

**Collaborate**:
- Experimental validation (we have 15 testable predictions!)
- Lean formalization (Sprints 7-10 in progress)
- Paper review and feedback
- Computational exploration (extend to N=7,8)

**Build Community**:
- Welcome newcomers from physics, math, CS, and philosophy
- Be rigorous but patient—questions at all levels welcome
- Critique ideas constructively (we're all here to learn)
- Remember: extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, so critical examination is encouraged 💪
