# Multi-LLM Expert Consultation System

## Overview

A Python framework for parallel consultation across multiple AI models (Grok, ChatGPT, Gemini) with automatic response synthesis and validation. Originally developed for formal verification in Lean 4, but applicable to any domain requiring diverse AI perspectives.

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Parallel API queries (3 experts simultaneously)
- ✅ Response synthesis and recommendation extraction
- ✅ Domain-specific validation (e.g., Lean 4 vs Lean 3 syntax)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite
- ✅ Session logging and result tracking

---

## Architecture & Design Philosophy

This system was originally developed to work **in conjunction with Claude Code** (Anthropic's AI coding assistant) for the Physical Logic Framework project. The architecture demonstrates a powerful pattern:

### Two-Tier AI Architecture

**Tier 1: Primary Development Assistant (e.g., Claude Code)**
- Full repository access and file editing capabilities
- Session context and continuity across conversations
- Direct code execution and build verification
- Prompt engineering and query formulation
- Integration of multi-LLM responses into codebase

**Tier 2: Expert Consultation Panel (This System)**
- Parallel queries to 3 specialized AI models (Grok-3, GPT-4, Gemini)
- Diverse perspectives on complex problems
- Response synthesis and consensus detection
- Domain-specific validation (e.g., Lean 3 vs Lean 4 detection)

### Why This Architecture Works

1. **Primary assistant handles prompt engineering** - Crafts detailed, context-rich queries optimized for the consultation panel
2. **Expert panel provides diverse viewpoints** - Different models may suggest different approaches
3. **Primary assistant synthesizes results** - Integrates recommendations into actual code changes
4. **Validation layer catches issues** - Domain-specific checks (like Lean version detection) prevent costly mistakes

### Example Workflow (Physical Logic Framework)

```
User: "Fix the Lean 4 compilation error in FeasibilityRatio.lean"
  ↓
Claude Code (Primary Assistant):
  1. Reads error message and problematic code
  2. Formulates detailed consultation prompt with full context
  3. Calls MultiLLMBridge.consult_all_experts()
  ↓
Multi-LLM System (This Package):
  1. Queries Grok, ChatGPT, Gemini in parallel
  2. Validates responses (detects Lean 3 vs Lean 4 syntax)
  3. Synthesizes recommendations
  4. Returns structured results
  ↓
Claude Code:
  1. Reviews all 3 expert suggestions
  2. Identifies consensus and contradictions
  3. Edits actual .lean files with verified fixes
  4. Runs build to confirm success
  ↓
User: Sees working code with insights from 4 AI systems
```

### Standalone Use Cases

While designed to work with a primary AI assistant, this system is **fully functional standalone** for:

- **Code Review Workflows** - Get multiple expert opinions on code quality
- **Research & Exploration** - Gather diverse perspectives on technical topics
- **Decision Support** - Compare approaches with multi-model consensus
- **Learning & Education** - See how different AI models explain concepts
- **API Reliability** - Hedge against single-API failures or rate limits

**The key insight**: A primary AI assistant with repo access can do tremendous work, but consulting a diverse expert panel for complex decisions produces better results than any single model alone.

## Lean 4 Formal Verification: The Original Use Case

This system was originally developed for **formal mathematical proof verification** in Lean 4, part of the Physical Logic Framework project. Understanding this use case reveals the system's power and design rationale.

### The Challenge: Lean 4 Theorem Proving

**Lean 4** is a theorem prover and programming language used for formal verification - writing mathematical proofs that are mechanically checked for correctness. It's extraordinarily powerful but notoriously difficult:

- **Steep learning curve** - Complex syntax, type theory, dependent types
- **Rapidly evolving** - Lean 4 is fundamentally different from Lean 3
- **Large library (Mathlib)** - 1M+ lines of formalized mathematics
- **Cryptic error messages** - Compilation errors require deep expertise
- **Multiple valid approaches** - Same theorem can be proven many ways

### Why Multi-LLM Consultation Was Essential

When working on formal proofs for the Physical Logic Framework (deriving quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry from logical principles), several problems emerged:

1. **AI models frequently suggested Lean 3 syntax** - Even when explicitly asked for Lean 4
2. **Single models had knowledge gaps** - Missing recent Mathlib theorems or techniques
3. **Compilation errors were cryptic** - Needed multiple perspectives to diagnose
4. **Proof strategies varied widely** - Different models suggested different valid approaches

### The Lean 4 Validation System

The code includes **automatic Lean 3 vs Lean 4 detection**:

```python
def validate_lean4_response(self, response_text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Validate if response is Lean 4 (not Lean 3) and flag issues."""

    lean3_indicators = [
        'import analysis.',      # Lean 3 used lowercase imports
        'import data.',
        'begin\n',               # Lean 3 tactic blocks used 'begin...end'
        'cases\'',               # Lean 3 syntax
    ]

    lean4_indicators = [
        'import Mathlib.',       # Lean 4 uses capitalized Mathlib
        'by\n',                  # Lean 4 uses 'by' for tactics
        'obtain',                # Lean 4 preferred syntax
        'rcases',
    ]

    # Count indicators and warn if Lean 3 detected
    # Returns validation result with warnings
```

**Why this matters**: Even GPT-4, trained on vast code, would frequently return Lean 3 solutions that looked correct but failed compilation in Lean 4. The validation system catches this automatically.

### Real-World Example: Mean Value Theorem Problem

**The Task**: Prove that a function with positive derivative is strictly monotonic, using the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) in Lean 4.

**The Problem**:
- Lean 4's Mathlib has MVT theorems, but they're complex to use
- Error message: `unknown identifier 'MonotoneOn.exists_slope_le_deriv'`
- Need to find the correct Mathlib theorem and apply it properly

**Multi-LLM Consultation**:

```python
bridge = MultiLLMBridge()

prompt = """
LEAN 4 THEOREM PROVING CONSULTATION

CURRENT ISSUE: Need to prove monotonicity from positive derivative

CURRENT CODE:
theorem temporal_ordering (ε₁ ε₂ : ℝ) (h₁ : ε₁ > 0) (h₂ : ε₂ > 0) :
  ε₁ < ε₂ ↔ C ε₁ < C ε₂ := by
  -- Need MVT approach
  sorry

CONTEXT: Already proven derivative C'(ε) > 0 for all ε > 0

REQUESTS:
1. What Mathlib MVT theorems exist for this?
2. Working Lean 4 code (not Lean 3!)
3. Alternative proof strategies if MVT is too complex
"""

responses = await bridge.consult_all_experts(prompt)
synthesis = bridge.synthesize_responses(responses)
```

**Results** (actual from development):
- **Grok**: Suggested `Monotone.deriv_pos` approach with Lean 4 syntax ✓
- **ChatGPT**: Provided Lean 3 syntax (caught by validator) ✗
- **Gemini**: Suggested `StrictMonoOn.of_deriv_pos` alternative approach ✓

**Outcome**: Claude Code reviewed all three suggestions, identified Grok's approach was most direct, adapted it to the specific theorem, and successfully compiled. The Lean 3 response was flagged automatically, saving debugging time.

### Implications for Other Domains

The Lean 4 use case demonstrates patterns applicable to any complex technical domain:

#### 1. Version Validation is Critical

**Lean 4 Problem**: AI models mix Lean 3/4 syntax
**General Pattern**: Validate for version-specific syntax (Python 2/3, Angular 1/2, React class/hooks, etc.)

**Implementation**:
```python
# Customize validate_response() for your domain
def validate_response(self, response_text: str):
    old_indicators = ['your_deprecated_syntax']
    new_indicators = ['your_current_syntax']
    # Return warnings if old syntax detected
```

#### 2. Multiple Valid Approaches

**Lean 4 Problem**: Same theorem, many proof strategies
**General Pattern**: Complex problems have multiple valid solutions with different trade-offs

**Benefit**: Multi-LLM gives you 3 different approaches to choose from based on your constraints (simplicity, performance, maintainability).

#### 3. Knowledge Gaps Vary by Model

**Lean 4 Problem**: Different models know different Mathlib theorems
**General Pattern**: Each AI has different strengths and training data

**Example**: When asking about AWS infrastructure:
- One model might suggest Lambda + DynamoDB
- Another might suggest ECS + RDS
- Another might suggest EKS + Aurora

All valid, different trade-offs. Consultation reveals options you wouldn't get from a single model.

#### 4. Cryptic Errors Need Multiple Perspectives

**Lean 4 Problem**: `unknown identifier` - which Mathlib import is missing?
**General Pattern**: Compilation/runtime errors with unclear causes

**Example**: Database query timeout - is it:
- Missing index? (Performance issue)
- Lock contention? (Concurrency issue)
- Query plan problem? (Optimizer issue)
- Network latency? (Infrastructure issue)

Different AI models may diagnose different root causes. Consultation helps triangulate the real issue.

### Key Takeaways from Lean 4 Development

1. **Validation catches costly mistakes** - Lean 3 syntax would waste hours of debugging
2. **Diverse perspectives reveal better solutions** - Found simpler theorems than initially considered
3. **Consensus builds confidence** - When 2-3 models agree, solution is likely robust
4. **Contradictions highlight risks** - When models disagree, investigate carefully before implementing

### Using This System for Lean 4 (If You're Working on Formal Proofs)

The system is **pre-configured for Lean 4** with:

```json
{
  "lean_specific_prompts": {
    "system_prompt": "You are an expert in formal verification, Lean 4, mathematical logic, and quantum mechanics. Provide detailed, technically accurate solutions with working code examples.",

    "compilation_error_template": "LEAN 4 COMPILATION ERROR RESOLUTION\n\nError Message:\n{error_message}\n\nProblematic Code:\n```lean\n{lean_code}```\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Root cause analysis\n2. Specific fixes with corrected code\n3. Alternative approaches\n4. Best practices"
  }
}
```

**Special Methods** in `claude_llm_bridge.py`:

```python
async def lean_mvt_consultation(self, theorem_code, issue_description, context=""):
    """Specialized consultation for Lean 4 MVT problems"""
    # Formats comprehensive Lean 4 consultation prompts
    # Includes automatic Lean 3/4 validation
    # Returns synthesis with Mathlib theorem recommendations

# Usage:
result = await bridge.lean_mvt_consultation(
    theorem_code=your_lean_code,
    issue_description="Need to prove monotonicity from derivative",
    context="Logic Field Theory formal verification"
)
```

### Resources for Lean 4 Users

If you're using this system for Lean 4 work:

- **Lean 4 Documentation**: https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/
- **Mathlib4 Docs**: https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/
- **Zulip Chat**: https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/ (active community)
- **Physical Logic Framework**: Example of real-world Lean 4 proofs using this system

**Pro Tip**: When consulting the multi-LLM panel about Lean 4, always:
1. Include full error messages
2. Specify Lean 4 explicitly (not just "Lean")
3. Mention Mathlib version if known
4. Request multiple approaches (MVT vs direct proof vs induction, etc.)
5. Review validation warnings - Lean 3 suggestions won't compile!

## Customization

### Domain-Specific System Prompts

Edit `api_config.json` to customize expert behavior:

```json
{
  "lean_specific_prompts": {
    "system_prompt": "You are an expert in [YOUR DOMAIN]. Provide detailed, technically accurate solutions."
  }
}
```

Examples:
- **Web Development**: "You are a senior full-stack developer..."
- **Data Science**: "You are a data scientist specialized in ML..."
- **DevOps**: "You are a DevOps engineer expert in cloud infrastructure..."

### Custom Validation

Add your own validation logic in `claude_llm_bridge.py`:

```python
def validate_response(self, response_text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Customize for your domain"""
    # Example: Check for Python 2 vs Python 3
    python2_indicators = ['print ', 'xrange', 'raw_input']
    python3_indicators = ['print(', 'range', 'input']

    # Your validation logic
    return {
        'is_valid': True,
        'warnings': []
    }
```

### Response Synthesis Keywords

Modify `synthesize_responses()` to extract domain-specific patterns:

```python
# Look for your domain keywords
if any(keyword in content for keyword in ['docker', 'kubernetes', 'container']):
    recommendations["devops_approaches"].append({
        "source": response['source'],
        "suggestion": response['content']
    })
```

---

    Please provide:
    1. Root cause analysis
    2. Immediate fixes
    3. Long-term solutions
    4. Best practices
    """

    responses = await self.consult_all_experts(prompt)
    synthesis = self.synthesize_responses(responses)

    return {

## Example Projects

### Project 1: Multi-Model Code Review

```python
async def code_review_pipeline(code_snippet, language):
    bridge = MultiLLMBridge()

    prompt = f"""
    Review this {language} code for:
    1. Bugs and errors
    2. Performance issues
    3. Security vulnerabilities
    4. Best practices

    Code:
    {code_snippet}
    """

    responses = await bridge.consult_all_experts(prompt)

    # Aggregate findings
    all_issues = []
    for response in responses:
        if response['success']:
            # Extract issues (customize parsing)
            all_issues.append({
                'source': response['source'],
                'review': response['content']
            })

    return all_issues
```

### Project 2: Research Assistant

```python
async def research_topic(topic, depth='comprehensive'):
    bridge = MultiLLMBridge()

    questions = [
        f"What are the fundamentals of {topic}?",
        f"What are current trends in {topic}?",
        f"What are best practices for {topic}?",
        f"What are common pitfalls in {topic}?"
    ]

    research = {}
    for question in questions:
        responses = await bridge.consult_all_experts(question)
        research[question] = bridge.synthesize_responses(responses)

    return research
```

### Project 3: Decision Support System

```python
async def technical_decision(options, criteria):
    bridge = MultiLLMBridge()

    prompt = f"""
    I need to choose between: {', '.join(options)}

    Criteria:
    {criteria}

    Provide:
    1. Pros and cons of each option
    2. Recommendation with rationale
    3. Implementation considerations
    """

    responses = await bridge.consult_all_experts(prompt)
    synthesis = bridge.synthesize_responses(responses)

    # Consensus or divergence?
    recommendations = [r['content'] for r in responses if r['success']]

    return {
        'consensus': len(set(recommendations)) == 1,
        'recommendations': recommendations,
        'synthesis': synthesis
    }
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Prompt Engineering

**Good Prompt**:
```python
prompt = """
PROBLEM: API latency increased from 100ms to 500ms after deployment

CONTEXT:
- Microservices architecture
- 10k requests/minute
- Added new caching layer yesterday

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Identify likely causes
2. Suggest diagnostic steps
3. Propose solutions with trade-offs
"""
```

**Poor Prompt**:
```python
prompt = "API is slow, help?"
```

### 2. Response Validation

Always validate before using AI suggestions:
```python
responses = await bridge.consult_all_experts(prompt)

# Check consensus
successful = [r for r in responses if r['success']]
if len(successful) < 2:
    print("Warning: Low response rate, consider retrying")

# Check for contradictions
# Implement your validation logic
```

### 3. Cost Management

```python
# Monitor token usage
total_tokens = sum(len(r['content']) for r in responses if r['success'])
estimated_cost = total_tokens * 0.00003  # Example rate

print(f"Estimated cost: ${estimated_cost:.4f}")
```

### 4. Rate Limiting

```python
import asyncio

# Add delays between batches
for prompt_batch in batches:
    results = await bridge.consult_all_experts(prompt_batch)
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # 1 second between batches
```

---

## Security Notes

⚠️ **CRITICAL SECURITY PRACTICES**:

1. **Never commit API keys**
   ```bash
   # Add to .gitignore
   echo "api_config.json" >> .gitignore
   echo "consultation_log_*.json" >> .gitignore
   ```

2. **Use environment variables** (alternative to config file)
   ```python
   import os

   config = {
       "api_keys": {
           "grok": os.getenv('GROK_API_KEY'),
           "chatgpt": os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'),
           "gemini": os.getenv('GEMINI_API_KEY')
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Rotate keys regularly**
   - Generate new keys monthly
   - Revoke old keys immediately if compromised

4. **Monitor usage**
   - Set up billing alerts
   - Review API logs for unusual activity

## Extending the Framework

### Add New AI Models

```python
async def query_claude(self, prompt: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Add Claude API support"""
    headers = {
        "x-api-key": self.config['api_keys']['claude'],
        "anthropic-version": "2023-06-01",
        "content-type": "application/json"
    }

    payload = {
        "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
        "max_tokens": 4000,
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    }

    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.post(
            "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages",
            headers=headers,
            json=payload
        ) as response:
            # Handle response
            pass
```

### Custom Analysis

```python
def analyze_consensus(self, responses):
    """Determine if experts agree"""
    contents = [r['content'] for r in responses if r['success']]

    # Simple similarity check
    if len(contents) < 2:
        return {"consensus": False, "reason": "Insufficient responses"}

    # Implement similarity algorithm
    # Return consensus analysis
```
