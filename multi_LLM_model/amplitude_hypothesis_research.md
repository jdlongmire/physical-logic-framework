**Priority**: CRITICAL (Priority 1 research problem)

## The Problem

### **Unproven Conjecture**

We conjecture that quantum amplitudes are proportional to constraint satisfaction:

```
|a_σ|² ∝ indicator(h(σ) ≤ K(N))
```

Where:
- σ is a permutation in the symmetric group Sₙ
- h(σ) is the inversion count of σ
- K(N) is a constraint threshold (K(3)=1, K(4)=2, etc.)
- a_σ is the quantum amplitude for state σ

### **Why This Matters**

**Without this proof, we have**:
- A mathematical framework (I2PS, constraint counting)
- Computational predictions (N=3: ρ₃=1/2, N=4: ρ₄=3/8)
- Formal verification (82% Lean proof completion)

**With this proof, we get**:
- Derivation of Born rule from logical constraints
- Explanation of quantum probabilities from information theory
- Major breakthrough in quantum foundations

**Current Status**: UNPROVEN - this is an ad-hoc assumption

## What We Know

### **Verified Results**

1. **N=3 Case** (formally proven):
   - Total permutations: 6
   - Valid arrangements (h ≤ 1): 3
   - Feasibility ratio: ρ₃ = 1/2
   - Quantum state: |ψ⟩ = (1/√3)[|σ₁⟩ + |σ₂⟩ + |σ₃⟩]
   - Born probabilities: P(σᵢ) = 1/3 for each valid σᵢ

2. **N=4 Case** (formally proven):
   - Total permutations: 24
   - Valid arrangements (h ≤ 2): 9
   - Feasibility ratio: ρ₄ = 3/8
   - Predicted Born probabilities: P(σᵢ) = 1/9 for each valid σᵢ

3. **Mathematical Framework**:
   - Information space: Ω = ∏(n=1→∞) Sₙ
   - Logical operator: L = ID ∘ NC ∘ EM (constraint filtering)
   - Constraint threshold: K(N) ≈ N*(N-1)/4 (entropic bound)

### **The Gap**

We **compute** constraint satisfaction counts and **assume** they equal |a_σ|².

We need to **derive** this connection from fundamental principles.

## Research Questions

### **Primary Question**

**Can we prove that quantum amplitudes must be proportional to constraint satisfaction counts?**

Specifically:
```
|a_σ|² = c · indicator(h(σ) ≤ K(N))
```
where c is a normalization constant.

### **Subsidiary Questions**

## Specific Mathematical Questions

### **Question 1: Representation Theory**

The symmetric group Sₙ has irreducible representations labeled by partitions λ of N.

**Can we express the constraint indicator function as**:
```
I(h(σ) ≤ K) = Σ_λ c_λ χ_λ(σ)
```
where χ_λ are irreducible characters and c_λ are coefficients?

**If yes**:
- What are the coefficients c_λ?
- Do they have a natural interpretation?
- Can we relate this to quantum amplitudes?

### **Question 2: Maximum Entropy**

Consider the optimization problem:
```
maximize: H(P) = -Σ_σ P(σ) log P(σ)
subject to: Support(P) ⊆ {σ : h(σ) ≤ K}
           Σ_σ P(σ) = 1
```

**Does this give**:
```
P(σ) = 1/|{σ : h(σ) ≤ K}|  for h(σ) ≤ K
P(σ) = 0                     otherwise
```

**And can we derive**:
```
|a_σ|² = P(σ)
```
from quantum information principles?

### **Question 3: Inversion Count Properties**

The inversion count h(σ) has known properties:
- h(σ) = 0 iff σ = identity
- h(σ) ≤ N(N-1)/2 (maximum for reversal)
- h(στ) ≤ h(σ) + h(τ) (subadditivity?)

**Questions**:
1. Is h(σ) a metric or quasi-metric on Sₙ?
2. Does it relate to the Cayesian metric (minimum transpositions)?
3. Can we use this metric structure to define amplitudes?

### **Question 4: Quantum Information Connection**

**Is there a connection to**:
- Quantum Fisher information
- Fubini-Study metric on projective Hilbert space
- Geometric phases / Berry phases
- Quantum state distinguishability

**Could amplitudes arise from**:
- Maximum distinguishability principle?
- Minimum quantum Fisher information?
- Geometric volume in quantum state space?

## Success Criteria

### **Minimum Viable Proof**

Prove that any quantum state on Sₙ satisfying:
1. Some natural symmetry principle, AND
2. Some information-theoretic optimality condition

MUST have amplitudes proportional to constraint satisfaction:
```
|a_σ|² ∝ indicator(h(σ) ≤ K(N))
```

### **Ideal Proof**

Derive the amplitude formula from:
1. First principles (unitarity, locality, causality, etc.), OR
2. Maximum entropy + physically motivated constraints, OR
3. Representation theory + natural Sₙ structure
