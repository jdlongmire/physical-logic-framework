# K(N) = N-2 Literature Search Results

**Date**: October 16, 2025 (following Session 14.6)
**Purpose**: Determine novelty of K(N)=N-2 constraint threshold claim
**Status**: ⚠️ **MIXED RESULTS** - Mathematics known, application appears novel
**Search Duration**: ~20 targeted queries across multiple databases

---

## Executive Summary

**Critical Finding**: The **mathematics** of K(N)=N-2 (permutations with n-2 inversions) is **well-established combinatorics** (OEIS A001892, references dating to 1927-1966). However, the **application to quantum mechanics** via permutohedron geometry, MaxEnt Born rule derivation, and logical constraint frameworks **appears to be novel** - no literature found connecting these concepts.

**Positioning Recommendation**: Frame as **"Novel application of established mathematics to quantum foundations"** rather than **"Novel mathematical discovery."**

## Part 1: What IS Known (Established Literature)

### 1.1 Combinatorics: OEIS A001892

**Finding**: ✅ **KNOWN** - Well-established sequence

**OEIS A001892**: "Number of permutations of (1,...,n) having n-2 inversions (n≥2)"

**Key Properties**:
- Diagonal (k=n-2) of triangle A008302 (Mahonian numbers/permutations by inversions)
- Asymptotic formula: a(n) = 2^(2n-3)/√(πn) × Q × (1+O(n^{-1})), Q ≈ 0.288788095
- Computational methods via product formula (1-x^j)/(1-x) extracting coefficient of x^(n-2)

**Historical References**:
- Netto (1927)
- David, Kendall & Barton (1966)

**Triangle A008302 (Mahonian Numbers)**:
- Tabulates permutations by inversion count
- A001892 is the k=n-2 diagonal of this triangle
- Well-studied in Stanley, Pak, and other combinatorialists' work

**Major Index and Inversions**:
- Mahonian statistics enumerate permutations by various inversion-related properties
- The "major index" and "inversion number" are equidistributed over S_n
- K=n-2 represents a specific threshold in this standard classification

**Conclusion**: Mahonian statistics for permutations with n-2 inversions are textbook combinatorics, not novel.

- But no one uses 3FLL as **foundational ontology** for QM derivation

**Conclusion**: ✅ **NOVEL** - PLF's philosophical framework (A=L(I), 3FLL, IIS) appears unique.

---

### 2.5 Multiply-Justified K(N)=N-2 Threshold

**PLF Claims Three Independent Justifications**:
1. **Mahonian symmetry**: Maximum plateau in Mahonian distribution at k=n-2

**Conclusion**: ⚠️ **POTENTIALLY NOVEL** - The convergence of three justifications at K=N-2 may be PLF's insight.

---

## Part 3: Related Work (Not Quite the Same)

### 3.1 Information-Theoretic QM Foundations

**Extensive Prior Work** (PLF is adding to existing tradition):

1. **Wheeler (1990)**: "It from Bit"
   - Information as fundamental
   - QM emerges from information-theoretic principles
   - Philosophical, not mathematical framework

2. **Jaynes (1957+)**: MaxEnt foundations
   - Maximum entropy principle for statistical mechanics
   - Applied to quantum ensembles
   - Does NOT use symmetric groups or permutation structure

3. **Hardy (2001)**: "Quantum Theory From Five Reasonable Axioms"
   - ~400 citations
   - Operational axioms (simplicity, subspaces, composite systems)
   - Recovers QM structure, but different starting point than PLF

4. **Chiribella, D'Ariano, Perinotti (2011)**: "Informational derivation of quantum theory"
   - ~1000+ citations
   - Purification + local discriminability → QM
   - Highly influential, but NOT group-theoretic

5. **Caticha (2012+)**: "Entropic Dynamics"
   - Entropy + Fisher geometry → QM
   - Uses MaxEnt + geometric constraints
   - Does NOT use symmetric groups or K(N)=N-2

6. **QBism (Fuchs)**: Quantum Bayesianism
   - Subjective probabilities
   - Information-based interpretation
   - NOT a derivation framework

**Comparison**:
- PLF is **similar in spirit** to Hardy, Chiribella, Caticha (info-theoretic QM)
- PLF is **different in structure** (S_N, permutohedron, K(N)=N-2)
- PLF is **NOT first** information-theoretic approach
- PLF **adds** novel mathematical realization (symmetric groups)

### 3.2 Born Rule Alternatives and Derivations

**Research Found**:
- "Classification of all alternatives to the Born rule in terms of informational properties" (Quantum journal)
- "Any modification of the Born rule leads to a violation of the purification and local tomography principles" (Quantum journal)
- "The Born Rule—100 Years Ago and Today" (Neumaier, Entropy 2025)
  - **Critiques MaxEnt approaches as circular** (silently invoke Born rule)
  - Derives Born rule from definition of quantum detectors

**Derivation Attempts**:
- Deutsch, Greaves, Wallace: Decision-theoretic approaches (many-worlds)
- Zurek: "Envariance" approach
- All criticized as potentially circular

**Permutation Structure in Born Rule**:
- Search found mention of "permutation symmetry" in relation to Born rule
- Only **trivial permutations** allowed in some derivation approaches
- **NOT using Mahonian statistics or n-2 thresholds**

**Conclusion**: PLF's approach (MaxEnt on K(N)=N-2 constrained permutations → Born rule) is distinct from existing derivation attempts, but shares circularity challenges noted by Neumaier (2025).

---

### 3.3 Constraint Satisfaction and Permutations

**Literature Found** (computer science, NOT physics):
- "Finding and Counting Permutations via CSPs" (Algorithmica)
- "Domain permutation reduction for constraint satisfaction problems" (ScienceDirect)
- "Every ternary permutation constraint satisfaction problem parameterized above average has a kernel" (ScienceDirect)
- Random k-SAT threshold: 2^k log 2 - O(k)

**Key Point**: Constraint satisfaction literature uses permutations extensively, but for **algorithm design and computational complexity**, not **physics foundations**.

**No Bridge Found**: No papers connecting constraint satisfaction theory to quantum mechanics or Born rule.

---

### 4.3 Honest Abstract Language

**Recommended Framing**:

> "We present the Physical Logic Framework (PLF), an information-theoretic approach to quantum mechanics foundations that provides a concrete mathematical realization using symmetric group structures. Building on the established tradition of information-based QM derivations (Wheeler, Hardy, Chiribella), we apply the well-known Mahonian statistic k=n-2 (OEIS A001892) to quantum foundations by identifying it as a constraint threshold with three independent mathematical justifications: Mahonian distribution symmetry, Coxeter polytope theory, and maximum entropy principles. We formalize the framework in Lean 4 (138 axioms, 0 `sorry` statements) and derive testable predictions for finite-N quantum systems via permutohedron geometry. This work contributes a novel computational perspective complementing standard quantum formulations."

**Key Phrases**:
- "Apply" (not "discover") the k=n-2 threshold
- "Building on" (not "replacing") existing information-theoretic approaches
- "Concrete mathematical realization" (emphasize structure)
- "Novel computational perspective" (not "revolutionary foundation")
- "Complementing" (not "superseding") standard QM
