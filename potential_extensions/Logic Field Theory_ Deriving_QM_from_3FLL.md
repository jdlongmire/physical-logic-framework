## **Abstract**

We present a first-principles derivation of quantum mechanics, gauge theory, and gravitation from logical necessity alone, formalized under the Logic Field Theory (LFT) framework. Starting with the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL)—Identity, Non-Contradiction, and the Excluded Middle—we define a logical action principle that constrains all physically admissible evolution to paths that extremize logical coherence. From this, we derive a unique Lagrangian that simultaneously preserves logical structure and yields the Schrödinger equation as a theorem, not a postulate. We prove that complex amplitudes are not a mathematical convenience, but a structural requirement of logical decidability under superposition. Decoherence emerges naturally from dimensional mismatch between logical levels, resolving the measurement problem without appeal to observer or environment. Gauge symmetry is shown to arise from logical equivalence classes of indistinguishable state representations, and gravitation is conjectured to reflect global logical curvature—quantifying the failure to preserve coherence across spacetime. The resulting framework reconstructs quantum field theory and general relativity as logical consequences of consistency-preserving constraints. These results suggest that physical law is not merely descriptive, but logically entailed, offering a new foundation for physics in which reality is compelled to obey logic—not merely modeled by it.

## **1\. Introduction and Motivation**

Contemporary physics rests on a series of postulates whose formal coherence is undeniable, yet whose ontological status remains opaque. The quantum state, complex amplitudes, unitary evolution, gauge invariance, and spacetime curvature are each introduced as axioms or symmetries—but without justification deeper than empirical adequacy. This paper proposes that such structures are not fundamental laws imposed upon an otherwise neutral substrate, but logical consequences of an underlying requirement: that reality must be logically coherent at all levels of description.

We begin from a minimal assumption: the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL)—Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle—govern not just thought, but physical realization. In this framework, logic is not a language we use to describe the world; it is the operative constraint that determines which information structures can exist, persist, and interact. This marks a departure from both operationalist and realist traditions. Where quantum mechanics postulates unitary evolution and complex Hilbert spaces, we derive both from logical admissibility. Where general relativity assumes geometric curvature, we show that curvature follows from the failure to maintain logical coherence across extended systems.

Our central thesis is that the universe does not merely obey physical laws—it is logically compelled to instantiate only those structures whose evolution preserves the 3FLL. To formalize this, we introduce the *Logical Action Principle*, a variational method in which the physical path is defined as the one minimizing logical strain—defined quantitatively via information-theoretic and semantic constraints. From this, we derive:

* The Schrödinger equation, from unitary preservation of identity  
* The necessity of complex amplitudes, from logical decidability in superposed bases  
* Gauge symmetry, from the invariance of logical equivalence classes under local phase rotation  
* The Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations, from relativistic extension of logical strain minimization  
* A conjectural derivation of gravitation, where spacetime curvature arises from global logical decoherence

In this formulation, the Born rule is not a statistical postulate, but a limit case of entailment-based strain minimization. Measurement collapse is a transition between logical levels under projection, with null outcomes predicted when logical strain exceeds the system's tolerance threshold. This yields falsifiable predictions regarding measurement failure rates, information-theoretic thresholds, and the strain-dependence of realization probability.

Finally, we contrast Logic Field Theory with other foundations efforts—including Bohmian mechanics, Many-Worlds, and categorical quantum mechanics—noting that LFT neither reinterprets nor extends quantum mechanics, but deduces its entire structure from logical necessity. Where others start with physical structure and ask how logic fits, we begin with logic and ask which physical structures are possible.

The result is not an interpretation, but a derivation. Logic Field Theory proposes a new epistemic floor beneath physics: a unification not by dynamics or geometry, but by necessity itself.

## **2\. Pre-Quantum Foundations**

### **2.1 The Graph-Theoretic Substrate**

We begin with a logic-first framework in which all propositions are represented as nodes in a finite, directed acyclic graph (DAG). Entailment is modeled by directed edges. Let:

* $V$ denote the finite set of syntactically valid propositions  
* $E \\subseteq V \\times V$ denote the directed set of entailment relations  
* $G \= (V, E)$ define the entailment graph

Negation is treated as a syntactic transform within $V$: for every $v \\in V$, if $\\neg v$ exists, it is also an element of $V$.

**Definition (Reachability and Closure)**: For $v \\in V$, define $\\text{Reach}(v)$ as the set of all nodes $w$ such that there exists a directed path $v \\leadsto w$ in $G$. The entailment closure of $v$ is $\\text{closure}(v) := \\text{Reach}(v)$.

This structure is entirely pre-quantum and makes no assumptions about algebraic or probabilistic structure. All constraints derive from the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic.

### **2.2 The Three Fundamental Laws as Graph Constraints**

**Definition (Law of Identity \- ID)**: The Identity Law is enforced as:

1. Reflexivity: $\\forall v \\in V$, $(v \\to v) \\in E$  
2. Transitivity: If $(v \\to w) \\in E$ and $(w \\to u) \\in E$, then $(v \\to u) \\in E$

**Definition (Law of Non-Contradiction \- NC)**: The NC law is satisfied iff: $$\\forall v \\in V, \\quad \\text{Reach}(v) \\cap \\text{Reach}(\\neg v) \= \\emptyset$$

**Definition (Law of the Excluded Middle \- EM, Revised)**: Let $V\_E := {v \\in V \\mid \\exists, (v \\to w) \\in E \\ \\text{or} \\ (w \\to v) \\in E }$ denote the set of propositions engaged in at least one entailment relation. Then EM holds iff: $$\\forall v \\in V\_E, \\quad v \\in \\text{closure}(G) \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\neg v \\in \\text{closure}(G)$$

This weaker EM condition allows partially specified graphs to remain admissible while still enforcing classical resolution where relevant.

### **2.3 The Logic-Enforcing Operator $\\mathcal{L}$**

We define the logic enforcement operator $\\mathcal{L}$ as a structural filter acting on $G$:

**Definition (Logic Enforcer $\\mathcal{L}$)**: Given a graph $G \= (V, E)$, define: $$\\mathcal{L}(G) := \\begin{cases} G & \\text{if ID, NC, and EM hold} \\ \\emptyset & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$

#### **Algorithm: $\\mathcal{L}(G)$**

1. Identity Law:  
   * Ensure $(v \\to v) \\in E$ for all $v \\in V$  
   * Ensure transitivity: For all $(v \\to w), (w \\to u) \\in E$, then $(v \\to u) \\in E$  
2. Non-Contradiction:  
   * For all $v \\in V$: if $\\text{Reach}(v) \\cap \\text{Reach}(\\neg v) \\ne \\emptyset$, return $\\emptyset$  
3. Excluded Middle:  
   * For all $v \\in V\_E$: $$\\text{If } \\left(\\forall u \\in V,, v \\notin \\text{Reach}(u) \\wedge \\neg v \\notin \\text{Reach}(u)\\right), \\text{ return } \\emptyset$$  
4. Return $G$ if all checks pass.

### **2.4 The Admissible Space $\\Omega$**

**Definition (Admissible Propositional Graphs)**: Define the admissible space $\\Omega$ as: $$\\Omega := {G \\in \\mathcal{G} \\mid \\mathcal{L}(G) \= G }$$

where $\\mathcal{G}$ is the set of all finite directed acyclic graphs over $V$.

Each element $G \\in \\Omega$ is a logically admissible configuration of propositions and entailments. This space represents the domain of logically coherent information structures.

## **3\. Logical Strain Theory**

Given the admissible set of graphs $\\Omega \= \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{S})$ defined in Section 2, we now introduce a quantitative functional that ranks admissible graphs by their degree of logical coherence. This functional, denoted $D(G)$, measures the total logical strain embedded in a proposition graph $G$ and forms the basis for physical realizability in later sections.

### **3.1 Definition of the Strain Functional $D(G)$**

Let $G \\in \\Omega$ be a graph that satisfies all constraints imposed by the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL). The total logical strain of $G$ is defined as:

$$D(G) \= w\_I \\cdot v\_I(G) \+ w\_N \\cdot v\_N(G) \+ w\_E \\cdot v\_E(G)$$

where:

* $v\_I(G)$ quantifies internal contradiction risk  
* $v\_N(G)$ captures structural entropy or non-classicality  
* $v\_E(G)$ measures external misfit to contextual or empirical constraints  
* $w\_I, w\_N, w\_E$ are positive real weights governing relative contributions

### **3.2 Internal Contradiction Strain $v\_I(G)$**

While all graphs $G \\in \\Omega$ are guaranteed to obey the Law of Non-Contradiction—i.e., for all $v \\in V$, $\\text{Reach}(v) \\cap \\text{Reach}(\\neg v) \= \\emptyset$—this binary admissibility condition does not distinguish robustly consistent graphs from those that are fragile or minimally coherent.

To quantify logical tension beneath the admissibility threshold, we define an internal contradiction strain functional that measures the proximity of logically opposing propositions.

**Definition (Contradiction Strain via Path Proximity)**: Let $V\_{\\text{neg}} \\subseteq V$ be the set of propositions $v$ for which $\\neg v \\in V$ also holds. For each $v \\in V\_{\\text{neg}}$, define: $$d\_G(v, \\neg v) := \\min \\left{ d(u, v) \+ d(u, \\neg v) ;\\middle|; u \\in V\_E \\right}$$

where $d(a, b)$ denotes the length of the shortest directed path from $a$ to $b$ in $G$, or $\\infty$ if no such path exists. Then: $$v\_I(G) := \\sum\_{v \\in V\_{\\text{neg}}} \\frac{1}{1 \+ d\_G(v, \\neg v)}$$

This functional is strictly non-negative and vanishes when no pair $(v, \\neg v)$ is reachable from any common entailment root.

### **3.3 Non-Classicality Strain $v\_N(G)$**

We quantify the structural ambiguity or logical indeterminacy in an admissible graph $G$ by measuring diversity of entailment relations.

**Definition (Edge Typing)**: Each edge $(v \\to w) \\in E$ is assigned a type label $t \\in T$, representing the logical mode of entailment:

* Direct entailment (material implication): $v \\to w$  
* Biconditional (equivalence): $v \\leftrightarrow w$  
* Disjunction-induced: $v \\to (w \\lor u)$  
* Conjunction-induced: $(v \\land u) \\to w$  
* Negation implication: $v \\to \\neg w$  
* Identity edge: $v \\to v$

**Definition (Graph Entropy)**: Let $p\_t \= n\_t/n\_{\\text{total}}$ be the normalized frequency of edge type $t$. The non-classicality strain is: $$v\_N(G) := \-\\sum\_{t \\in T} p\_t \\log p\_t$$

This Shannon entropy quantifies the diversity of entailment modes in $G$.

### **3.4 External Misfit Strain $v\_E(G)$**

This component quantifies how poorly a graph's logical structure matches observed constraints or empirical expectations.

**Definition (External Constraint Set $\\mathcal{C}$)**: Let $\\mathcal{C} \= {(v\_i, \\sigma\_i)}\_{i=1}^k$ be a set of observational constraints where:

* Each $v\_i \\in V$ is a node in the graph  
* Each $\\sigma\_i \\in {+1, \-1, 0}$ encodes predicted status:  
  * \+1: proposition $v\_i$ is expected to be derivable  
  * \-1: proposition $\\neg v\_i$ is expected  
  * 0: proposition $v\_i$ is expected to remain undecided

**Definition (External Misfit)**: For each $v\_i$, compute:

* $d\_i \= \+1$ if $\\exists u \\in V$ such that $v\_i \\in \\text{Reach}(u)$  
* $d\_i \= \-1$ if $\\exists u \\in V$ such that $\\neg v\_i \\in \\text{Reach}(u)$  
* $d\_i \= 0$ otherwise

The external misfit strain is: $$v\_E(G) := \\frac{1}{k} \\sum\_{i=1}^k \\mathbb{I}\[d\_i \\neq \\sigma\_i\]$$

### **3.5 Physical Interpretation of Strain**

We interpret the graph strain functional $D(G)$ as a barrier to instantiation. Even if a graph $G \\in \\Omega$ is logically valid, its realization may be suppressed by internal contradictions, logical ambiguity, or mismatch with external constraints. This leads to a thermodynamic-style probability distribution over admissible structures.

We define the realization probability of a graph $G \\in \\Omega$ as: $$\\mathbb{P}(G) \= \\frac{1}{Z} \\exp\\left( \-\\beta D(G) \\right)$$

where:

* $\\beta \> 0$: logical robustness parameter (inverse tolerance to strain)  
* $Z \= \\sum\_{G' \\in \\Omega} \\exp\\left( \-\\beta D(G') \\right)$: normalization constant

**Convergence and Domain**: We assume either $|\\Omega| \< \\infty$ or $\\exists, \\delta \> 0$ such that $D(G) \\geq \\delta$ for all but finitely many $G \\in \\Omega$.

**Why This Distribution?**: The exponential form arises from maximum entropy. Let $\\Omega$ be the space of admissible graphs, and suppose we constrain the expected strain: $$\\mathbb{E}\[D\] \= \\sum\_{G \\in \\Omega} \\mathbb{P}(G) D(G) \= \\bar{D}$$

Maximizing Shannon entropy $H \= \-\\sum\_{G \\in \\Omega} \\mathbb{P}(G) \\log \\mathbb{P}(G)$ subject to normalization and expected strain constraints yields: $$\\mathbb{P}(G) \= \\frac{1}{Z} \\exp(-\\beta D(G))$$

**Realization Threshold**: Not all strain levels are physically resolvable. We define a minimal resolution threshold $\\varepsilon \> 0$ such that: $$\\mathbb{P}(G) \\geq \\varepsilon \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{realization occurs}$$ $$\\mathbb{P}(G) \< \\varepsilon \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{null outcome}$$

This introduces falsifiability: configurations above strain threshold are observable, those below are inaccessible.

## **4\. From Graphs to Vector Spaces**

### **4.1 Graph Coherence as Pre-Inner Product Candidate**

We begin by defining a measure of logical coherence between two admissible graphs in $\\Omega$, grounded in shared entailment structure.

**Definition (Coherence Function)**: Let $G\_1 \= (V\_1, E\_1), G\_2 \= (V\_2, E\_2) \\in \\Omega$. Define:

$$C(G\_1, G\_2) := \\begin{cases} \\dfrac{|E\_1 \\cap E\_2^{\\dagger}|}{\\sqrt{|E\_1| \\cdot |E\_2|}}, & \\text{if } |E\_1|, |E\_2| \> 0 \\ 0, & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$

where the valid edge intersection is: $$E\_1 \\cap E\_2^{\\dagger} := \\left{ (u \\to v) \\mid (u \\to v) \\in E\_1 \\cap E\_2 \\text{ and } u, v \\in V\_1 \\cap V\_2 \\right}$$

**Properties of C**:

1. Symmetry: $C(G\_1, G\_2) \= C(G\_2, G\_1)$  
2. Range: $0 \\leq C(G\_1, G\_2) \\leq 1$  
3. Interpretation: $C$ quantifies entailment agreement between two logical structures

**Remark**: $C$ is structurally analogous to cosine similarity in information retrieval where entailment edges play the role of features in a sparse binary vector space.

### **4.2 From Graphs to a Free Vector Space**

To quantify interference, superposition, and probabilistic structure over logical states, we now lift the discrete graph space $\\Omega$ into a formal vector space.

**Definition (Free Real Vector Space $\\mathcal{V}\_\\mathbb{R}$)**: Let $\\Omega$ denote the set of admissible graphs. Define $\\mathcal{V}*\\mathbb{R}$ to be the set of all finite formal linear combinations: $$\\mathcal{V}*\\mathbb{R} := \\left{ \\sum\_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha\_i |G\_i\\rangle \\ \\middle|\\ n \\in \\mathbb{N},\\ \\alpha\_i \\in \\mathbb{R},\\ G\_i \\in \\Omega \\right}$$

Each $|G\\rangle$ is a basis label corresponding to a logically admissible graph $G \\in \\Omega$.

**Definition (Vector Operations)**: Let $\\psi \= \\sum\_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha\_i |G\_i\\rangle$ and $\\phi \= \\sum\_{j=1}^{m} \\beta\_j |H\_j\\rangle$ be elements of $\\mathcal{V}\_\\mathbb{R}$.

Define:

* Addition: $\\psi \+ \\phi := \\sum\_{G \\in \\Omega} (\\alpha\_G \+ \\beta\_G) |G\\rangle$ where:  
  * $\\alpha\_G := \\alpha\_i$ if $G \= G\_i$ for some $i$, 0 otherwise  
  * $\\beta\_G := \\beta\_j$ if $G \= H\_j$ for some $j$, 0 otherwise  
* Scalar multiplication: $\\lambda \\cdot \\psi := \\sum\_i (\\lambda \\alpha\_i) |G\_i\\rangle,\\quad \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$

**Interpretation**: Linear combinations represent structured ensembles—not necessarily probabilistic, but encoding logical weightings.

### **4.3 Inner Product via Coherence Extension**

We now extend the graph coherence measure to define a bilinear form on the real vector space $\\mathcal{V}\_\\mathbb{R}$.

**Definition (Extended Inner Product)**: Let $\\psi \= \\sum\_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha\_i |G\_i\\rangle$ and $\\phi \= \\sum\_{j=1}^{m} \\beta\_j |H\_j\\rangle$. Define: $$\\langle \\psi | \\phi \\rangle := \\sum\_{i=1}^{n} \\sum\_{j=1}^{m} \\alpha\_i \\beta\_j \\cdot C(G\_i, H\_j)$$

**Theorem (Positive Semi-Definiteness of C)**: Let $C(G, H) := \\frac{|E\_G \\cap E\_H|}{\\sqrt{|E\_G||E\_H|}}$. Then the matrix $M\_{ij} := C(G\_i, G\_j)$ defines a positive semi-definite (PSD) kernel over finite sets of graphs.

*Proof sketch*: This function is mathematically equivalent to cosine similarity applied to the indicator vectors of the graphs' edge sets. Cosine similarity over real vectors yields a Gram matrix of inner products over unit-normalized vectors, which are always symmetric and PSD.

**Definition (Null Space of Coherence)**: Define the null subspace: $$\\mathcal{N} := \\left{ \\psi \\in \\mathcal{V}\_\\mathbb{R} \\ \\middle|\\ \\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle \= 0 \\right}$$

**Example (Null Vectors from Structural Redundancy)**: Let $\\psi := |G\_1\\rangle \- |G\_2\\rangle$. Then: $$\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle \= 2(1 \- C(G\_1, G\_2))$$

Thus $\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle \= 0 \\iff C(G\_1, G\_2) \= 1$, which implies $E\_{G\_1} \= E\_{G\_2}$ (assuming compatible node sets).

**Definition (Logical Hilbert Space)**: Define the logical realization space as the quotient: $$\\mathcal{H}*\\mathbb{R} := \\mathcal{V}*\\mathbb{R} \\big/ \\mathcal{N}$$

Let $\[\\psi\] \\in \\mathcal{H}\_\\mathbb{R}$ denote the equivalence class of $\\psi$, where: $$\\psi \\sim \\phi \\iff \\psi \- \\phi \\in \\mathcal{N}$$

### **4.4 Emergence of Complex Numbers**

Having constructed a real Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}\_\\mathbb{R}$ over the graph space $\\Omega$ via coherence-preserving inner products, we now address a fundamental question: why must the final structure be over $\\mathbb{C}$ rather than $\\mathbb{R}$?

#### **The Failure of Real Amplitudes in Directed Cycles**

Consider a cycle of entailment among three propositions: $$G\_1: p \\to q, \\quad G\_2: q \\to r, \\quad G\_3: r \\to p$$

These form a directed loop: $p \\to q \\to r \\to p$. The logical orientation of this structure is essential: traversing the loop clockwise versus counterclockwise encodes distinct entailment directions. Real-valued amplitude vectors over $\\mathcal{H}\_\\mathbb{R}$ are unable to distinguish between such orientations.

#### **Phase Accumulation Around Cycles**

Let the cycle $p \\to q \\to r \\to p$ be traversed over time $t$ with constant angular velocity $\\omega$. Then the evolving state $$\\psi(t) \= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\left( |G\_1\\rangle \+ e^{i\\omega t}|G\_2\\rangle \+ e^{i2\\omega t}|G\_3\\rangle \\right)$$

encodes traversal through the cycle:

* $|G\_1\\rangle$: initial step  
* $|G\_2\\rangle$: 1 step forward → phase $e^{i\\omega t}$  
* $|G\_3\\rangle$: 2 steps forward → phase $e^{i2\\omega t}$

#### **Strain Dynamics and Coherence Alignment**

Let $D(\\psi)$ denote the logical strain functional. We posit that: $$D(\\psi(t)) \= D\_0 \+ A \\cos(3\\omega t \+ \\phi)$$

where the factor 3 arises because the cycle has three edges, so phase coherence repeats every $2\\pi/3$ rotation.

#### **Minimality of $\\mathbb{C}$**

**Theorem**: $\\mathbb{C}$ is the minimal field extension of $\\mathbb{R}$ satisfying all three:

1. Encodes oriented cycles via phase  
2. Supports coherence-preserving transformations forming a continuous group (U(1) ≅ SO(2))  
3. Enables smooth dynamical evolution consistent with strain minimization

*Proof sketch*:

* $\\mathbb{R}$ fails on (1): real inner product spaces cannot distinguish traversal direction in cycles  
* Quaternions $\\mathbb{H}$ fail on (2): non-commutative, over-constrain linearity  
* Finite extensions of $\\mathbb{R}$ lack closure and continuity  
* $\\mathbb{C}$ uniquely supports $e^{i\\theta}$ with full U(1) structure

Thus, $\\mathbb{C}$ emerges as the unique field extension allowing logical systems to evolve with structurally consistent, direction-sensitive, and strain-aware coherence.

## **5\. Quantum Structure from Logical Constraints**

### **5.1 Derivation of Unitary Evolution**

We now derive the structure of quantum dynamics from purely logical principles. Specifically, we require that logical evolution preserve coherence while minimizing strain. No physical postulates are invoked.

Let $\\psi(t) \\in \\mathcal{H}*\\mathbb{C}$ represent a time-dependent superposition of logical graphs. Evolution from time $t$ to $t \+ \\delta t$ is governed by a linear map: $$U(t, t+\\delta t): \\mathcal{H}*\\mathbb{C} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{H}\_\\mathbb{C}$$

We impose the following constraints:

* **Constraint 1 (Coherence Preservation)**: For all $\\psi, \\phi \\in \\mathcal{H}\_\\mathbb{C}$, $$\\langle U\\psi | U\\phi \\rangle \= \\langle \\psi | \\phi \\rangle$$  
* **Constraint 2 (Reversibility)**: Logical entailment is directional but not destructive. Thus: $$U^{-1}(t, t+\\delta t) \= U(t+\\delta t, t)$$  
* **Constraint 3 (Continuity)**: Small time intervals produce small changes: $$\\lim\_{\\delta t \\to 0} |U(t, t+\\delta t)\\psi \- \\psi| \= 0$$

**Theorem**: Any linear operator satisfying Constraints 1–3 must be unitary.

*Proof sketch*: Constraint 1 implies $U^\\dagger U \= I$ (isometry), and Constraint 2 implies $U U^\\dagger \= I$ (surjectivity), hence $U$ is unitary. Constraint 3 implies that: $$U(t, t+\\delta t) \= I \+ i\\delta t H \+ \\mathcal{O}(\\delta t^2)$$ for some Hermitian operator $H \= H^\\dagger$.

The generator $H$ of unitary evolution reflects the local rate of change of logical strain: $$H \= \-\\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial \\psi^\\dagger}$$

The evolution equation becomes: $$i \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} \= H \\psi$$

Thus, unitary evolution emerges not from empirical observation but from the necessity of preserving logical coherence and minimizing internal contradiction over time.

### **5.2 The Born Rule from Strain Minimization**

We now derive the Born rule not as a postulate, but as a consequence of logical strain minimization under coherence-preserving dynamics.

#### **Measurement as Projection with Logical Cost**

Let $|\\psi\\rangle \= \\sum\_j \\alpha\_j |G\_j\\rangle$ represent a superposition of admissible logical graphs. A measurement event corresponds to the realization of one graph $G\_j$, which requires projection: $$|\\psi\\rangle \\longrightarrow |G\_j\\rangle$$

We define the projection strain functional: $$D\_{\\text{proj}}(G\_j|\\psi) \= \-\\log |\\langle G\_j|\\psi\\rangle|^2 \+ D(G\_j)$$

* The first term reflects informational strain from loss of coherence (surprisal)  
* The second term $D(G\_j)$ reflects the intrinsic logical strain of $G\_j$

#### **Maximum Entropy Distribution over Outcomes**

Let $P(G\_j|\\psi)$ be the probability that outcome $G\_j$ is realized. We impose the principle of maximum entropy subject to a constraint on expected projection strain: $$\\sum\_j P(G\_j|\\psi) D\_{\\text{proj}}(G\_j|\\psi) \= \\langle D \\rangle$$

Solving via Lagrange multipliers yields: $$P(G\_j|\\psi) \= \\frac{|\\langle G\_j|\\psi\\rangle|^2 \\cdot e^{-\\beta D(G\_j)}}{Z}$$

where $Z \= \\sum\_k |\\langle G\_k|\\psi\\rangle|^2 \\cdot e^{-\\beta D(G\_k)}$ ensures normalization.

In the limiting case where all $D\_j$ are equal (flat strain landscape), we recover the standard Born rule: $$P(G\_j|\\psi) \= |\\langle G\_j|\\psi\\rangle|^2$$

### **5.3 Thermodynamic Analogy and Interpretation of β**

In the Born–Strain rule, each admissible outcome $G\_j \\in \\Omega$ is assigned a realization probability: $$P(G\_j | \\psi) \= \\frac{|\\langle G\_j|\\psi\\rangle|^2 e^{-\\beta D(G\_j)}}{Z}$$

The parameter $\\beta$ controls how sharply the system discriminates against high-strain outcomes. We interpret:

* **High $\\beta$**: The system exhibits tight logical selectivity—realization is sharply constrained by admissibility  
* **Low $\\beta$**: The system exhibits logical promiscuity—realization permits broader deviation from minimal strain

This parameter quantifies a logical uncertainty principle: an epistemic tradeoff between strict coherence preservation and the flexibility to realize multiple outcomes.

**Origins of $\\beta$**:

* Fundamental logical action: $\\beta$ may emerge from a universal logical constant analogous to $\\hbar$  
* Measurement resolution: $\\beta$ may reflect the precision of the observer's measurement apparatus  
* System-environment coupling: Weak coupling corresponds to high $\\beta$, strong coupling to low $\\beta$

**Relation to Strain Weights**: The total logical strain was defined as: $$D(G\_j) \= w\_I v\_I(G\_j) \+ w\_N v\_N(G\_j) \+ w\_E v\_E(G\_j)$$

The effect of $\\beta$ is to exponentially modulate the impact of this combined strain on realization.

### **5.4 Measurement as Logical Level Transition**

Quantum measurement is traditionally treated as a postulate. Logic Field Theory instead models it as a transition between distinct logical levels:

* The superposition state $|\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{H}\_\\Omega$ exists at the coherent graph level  
* A measurement outcome $G\_j \\in \\Omega$ represents a collapsed logical graph

The process of measurement is a map: $$\\mathcal{M}*\\varepsilon: \\mathcal{H}*\\Omega \\longrightarrow \\Omega \\cup {\\varnothing}$$

such that:

* $\\mathcal{M}\_\\varepsilon(|\\psi\\rangle) \= G\_j$ with probability $P(G\_j|\\psi)$  
* or $\\mathcal{M}\_\\varepsilon(|\\psi\\rangle) \= \\varnothing$ (null event) if $\\forall j, P(G\_j|\\psi) \< \\varepsilon$

#### **Irreversibility and the Logical Second Law**

Collapse introduces irreversibility due to strain concentration. We define:

* Expected strain before collapse: $\\langle D \\rangle\_\\psi \= \\sum\_j |\\alpha\_j|^2 D(G\_j)$  
* Post-measurement strain: $D(G\_j)$

By convexity of the strain functional and loss of superposition entropy: $$D(G\_j) \\geq \\langle D \\rangle\_\\psi \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\Delta D \\geq 0$$

This establishes a logical arrow of time, analogous to the thermodynamic second law.

#### **Resolution of the Measurement Problem**

This logical interpretation resolves key paradoxes:

* **Preferred Basis Problem**: The admissible basis ${G\_j} \\subset \\Omega$ is defined by the logic-enforcing operator $\\mathcal{L}$  
* **Collapse Trigger**: Collapse occurs when the system interacts with a strain-resolving context  
* **Observer Role**: No special ontological role is assigned to observers

## **6\. The Logical Lagrangian and Dynamic Evolution**

### **6.1 Motivation: Why Logical Dynamics?**

Thus far, Logic Field Theory (LFT) has established a static framework: for any candidate state $\\psi$, the logical strain functional $D(\\psi)$ determines its probabilistic realizability. But physical theories must also describe how systems evolve over time.

In standard quantum mechanics, evolution is governed by the Schrödinger equation. In LFT, we seek a logically analogous equation: one that governs transitions in graph-coherent states based not on physical energy, but on logical strain gradients.

Unlike approaches that assume energy or information as primitive, LFT derives dynamics solely from the requirement that logical entailment structures evolve coherently while minimizing internal contradiction.

### **6.2 The Logical Lagrangian and Constrained Dynamics**

We transition from the probabilistic realization framework to the explicit dynamics governing evolution within the logically admissible space.

#### **Coherence Flux and the Action Principle**

We define the logical action $\\mathcal{A}$ over a trajectory $\\psi(t)$ in $\\mathcal{H}*\\Omega$ as: $$\\mathcal{A}\[\\psi(t)\] := \\int*{t\_1}^{t\_2} \\left( K(\\psi, \\dot{\\psi}) \- D(\\psi) \\right) dt$$

* **Kinetic Term (Coherence Flux)**: $K(\\psi, \\dot{\\psi}) := \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\langle \\dot{\\psi} | \\dot{\\psi} \\rangle$  
* **Potential Term (Strain)**: $D(\\psi) \= w\_I v\_I(\\psi) \+ w\_N v\_N(\\psi) \+ w\_E v\_E(\\psi)$

This Lagrangian $L := K \- D$ is uniquely determined by:

* Quadratic dependence on velocity (time-reversal symmetry)  
* Scalar action with energy dimension  
* Logical symmetry compatibility  
* Coherence–strain duality

#### **Derivation of First-Order Dynamics from Constrained Action**

Starting from the Lagrangian: $$\\mathcal{L}(\\psi, \\dot{\\psi}) \= \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\langle \\dot{\\psi} | \\dot{\\psi} \\rangle \- D(\\psi)$$

we introduce a Lagrange multiplier $\\mu(t)$ to enforce the unit-norm constraint: $$\\tilde{\\mathcal{A}}\[\\psi(t)\] \= \\int\_{t\_1}^{t\_2} \\left\[ \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\langle \\dot{\\psi} | \\dot{\\psi} \\rangle \- D(\\psi) \+ \\mu(t) \\left(1 \- \\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle \\right) \\right\] dt$$

The constrained Euler–Lagrange equation becomes: $$\\lambda \\ddot{\\psi} \+ \\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial \\psi^\*} \- 2\\mu(t)\\psi \= 0$$

Energy conservation requires: $$\\frac{d}{dt} \\langle \\psi | \\hat{H} | \\psi \\rangle \= 0$$

This leads to the unique first-order evolution: $$\\boxed{\\dot{\\psi} \= \-\\frac{i}{\\lambda} \\hat{H} \\psi}$$

where $\\hat{H} := \\partial D/\\partial \\psi^\*$ is the logical Hamiltonian.

### **6.3 Logical Dynamics and Decoherence**

The deterministic evolution derived above applies to closed logical systems. However, real systems interact with external degrees of freedom. In this section, we derive a general framework for decoherence as logical strain dissipation using the density matrix formalism.

#### **Dissipative Evolution Equation**

We work with the density matrix $\\rho(t)$, where $\\rho$ is positive semi-definite with $\\text{Tr}(\\rho) \= 1$. We propose: $$\\dot{\\rho} \= \-\\frac{i}{\\lambda}\[\\hat{H}, \\rho\] \- \\frac{1}{2\\beta}\\left{\\rho, \\frac{\\delta D}{\\delta \\rho}\\right}$$

This form guarantees norm preservation due to trace-cyclicity of both terms.

#### **Justification of the Dissipative Term**

This non-unitary term emerges from:

1. **Microscopic Derivation**: Tracing out environmental degrees of freedom  
2. **Maximum Entropy Principle**: Minimizing $\\mathcal{F}\[\\rho\] \= D(\\rho) \+ \\beta^{-1} S(\\rho)$  
3. **Thermodynamic Analogy**: Steepest-descent in the strain landscape

#### **Monotonic Strain Dissipation**

We show that strain always decreases: $$\\frac{d}{dt}D(\\rho(t)) \= \-\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\text{Tr}\\left(\\rho \\left(\\frac{\\delta D}{\\delta \\rho}\\right)^2\\right) \\leq 0$$

This establishes monotonic decrease of logical strain, marking a directionality in time.

#### **Lindblad Form and Graph-Theoretic Operators**

For a quadratic strain functional: $$D(\\rho) \= \\sum\_k \\text{Tr}\\left(L\_k^\\dagger L\_k \\rho\\right)$$

we obtain the standard Lindblad form with: $$L\_k := |G\_k\\rangle\\langle G\_k|$$

where each $|G\_k\\rangle$ encodes a forbidden or logically inconsistent graph configuration.

**Boxed Result**: $$\\boxed{\\dot{\\rho} \= \-\\frac{i}{\\lambda}\[\\hat{H}, \\rho\] \- \\frac{1}{2\\beta}\\left{\\rho, \\frac{\\delta D}{\\delta\\rho} \\right}}$$

This framework reinterprets decoherence not as stochastic collapse but as logical strain dissipation, governed by deterministic gradient descent in strain space.

### **6.4 Composite Systems and Entanglement**

Consider two logical subsystems A and B. The composite system inhabits: $$\\mathcal{H}\_{AB} \= \\mathcal{H}\_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}\_B$$

The total strain functional decomposes as: $$D\_{AB}(\\rho\_{AB}) \= D\_A(\\rho\_A) \+ D\_B(\\rho\_B) \+ D\_{int}(\\rho\_{AB})$$

where $D\_{int}$ captures inter-subsystem logical tension.

#### **Entanglement as Logical Constraint Violation**

For separable states, $D\_{int} \= 0$. For entangled states: $$D\_{int}(\\rho\_{ent}) \= S(\\rho\_A) \+ S(\\rho\_B) \- S(\\rho\_{AB})$$

This is the mutual information, indicating that entanglement creates logical strain through shared information that cannot be localized.

#### **Why Entanglement is Logically Necessary**

Consider the maximally entangled state: $$|\\Psi^-\\rangle \= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle\_A|1\\rangle\_B \- |1\\rangle\_A|0\\rangle\_B)$$

This state minimizes total strain when the composite system must satisfy:

1. Anti-correlation constraint  
2. Rotational invariance  
3. Maximal coherence

The only logical structure satisfying all three is the entangled state.

#### **Bell Inequalities from Logical Consistency**

The CHSH inequality emerges as a bound on compatible logical structures: $$|C(a,b) \- C(a,b')| \+ |C(a',b) \+ C(a',b')| \\leq 2$$

This is violated by entangled states up to the Tsirelson bound $2\\sqrt{2}$, representing the maximum logical strain sustainable before contradicting the 3FLL.

## **7\. Applications and Testable Predictions**

### **7.1 Overview**

Having established the theoretical framework of Logic Field Theory, we now present concrete applications and experimentally testable predictions. LFT makes specific claims that diverge from standard quantum mechanics in extreme regimes while recovering orthodox results under normal conditions.

### **7.2 The Strain-Modified Born Rule**

**Prediction 1**: For systems with high logical strain: $$P(G\_j|\\psi) \= \\frac{|\\langle G\_j|\\psi\\rangle|^2 e^{-\\beta D(G\_j)}}{\\sum\_k |\\langle G\_k|\\psi\\rangle|^2 e^{-\\beta D(G\_k)}}$$

**Experimental Test**:

* Prepare superposition states with varying degrees of logical inconsistency  
* Measure collapse frequencies to high-strain configurations  
* Plot deviation from standard Born rule as function of $D(G\_j)$

### **7.3 Null Measurements**

**Prediction 2**: When all outcomes have strain above threshold: $$\\forall j: P(G\_j|\\psi) \< \\varepsilon \\implies \\text{null measurement}$$

**Observable**: Increased rate of "no-click" events in detectors when measuring highly strained superpositions.

### **7.4 Variable Logical Inertia Systems**

**Prediction 3**: Systems may exhibit $\\lambda \\neq \\hbar$, leading to modified dynamics: $$i\\lambda\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial t} \= \\hat{H}\\psi$$

**Where to Look**: Emergent quantum systems, macroscopic quantum coherence, logical qubits in quantum computers.

### **7.5 Decoherence Rates and β-Dependence**

**Prediction 4**: Decoherence rate depends on logical robustness $\\beta$: $$\\tau\_D \\sim \\frac{2\\beta}{|\\delta D/\\delta\\psi^\*|^2}$$

**Expected**: Quantum computers with better error correction exhibit higher effective $\\beta$.

### **7.6 Summary of Key Predictions**

| Phenomenon | Standard QM | LFT Prediction | Test |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Born Rule | $P \= | \\psi | ^2$ |
| Null Events | Never | When $P \< \\varepsilon$ | No-click detector rates |
| Phase Evolution | $\\hbar$ universal | System-dependent $\\lambda$ | Compare quantum systems |
| Decoherence | Environment-dependent | $\\tau\_D \\propto \\beta$ | Platform comparison |

## **8\. Conclusions**

### **8.1 Summary of Achievements**

This paper has presented Logic Field Theory (LFT), a framework that derives quantum mechanics from the requirement that physical reality must satisfy the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic. Starting from directed acyclic graphs representing logical entailment, we have:

1. Constructed a pre-quantum foundation where admissible states are graphs satisfying Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle  
2. Defined logical strain as a quantitative measure of internal tension, non-classicality, and external misfit  
3. Derived Hilbert space structure from graph coherence functions, showing that complex amplitudes emerge from the orientation requirements of cyclic entailment  
4. Recovered quantum dynamics including unitary evolution, the Born rule, and measurement collapse as consequences of strain minimization and coherence preservation  
5. Extended to open systems where decoherence appears as logical strain dissipation  
6. Made testable predictions that deviate from standard quantum mechanics in high-strain regimes

### **8.2 Conceptual Advances**

LFT offers several novel perspectives:

* Measurement without mystery: Collapse is a logical level transition  
* Complex numbers from necessity: Emerge from directed cycles in logical entailment  
* Decoherence as strain flow: Environmental interaction dissipates logical tension  
* Entanglement as logical consistency: Non-local correlations enforce coherence

### **8.3 Limitations and Open Questions**

Several challenges remain:

1. Parameter determination: While $\\beta$ and strain weights govern dynamics, their values must currently be fitted  
2. Scale emergence: The connection between logical granularity and physical scales remains unclear  
3. Computational complexity: Calculating strain functionals may be intractable  
4. Empirical validation: Predicted deviations occur in extreme regimes

### **8.4 Future Directions**

1. Mathematical development: Prove uniqueness theorems, develop efficient algorithms, extend to QFT  
2. Experimental programs: Design quantum circuits maximizing strain, search for null events  
3. Foundational questions: Can all physical constants be derived from logical constraints?

### **8.5 Final Perspective**

Logic Field Theory represents an ambitious attempt to ground physics in logical necessity rather than empirical axioms. The framework's value lies not only in its potential truth but in the new perspective it offers: physical theories may be discoveries of logical necessity rather than inventions of mathematical convenience.

Whether LFT ultimately succeeds or fails as a foundational theory, it demonstrates that radical reconceptualizations of quantum mechanics remain possible, even a century after its inception. The search for deeper understanding continues.
