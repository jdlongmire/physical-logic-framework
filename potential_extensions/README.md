# Potential Extensions to Logic Field Theory

This directory contains speculative extensions and alternative approaches to Logic Field Theory that require further mathematical development before integration into the main framework.

## Contents

**Logic Field Theory: Deriving QM from 3FLL.md**
- Alternative approach starting from Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle)
- Uses directed acyclic graphs and logical strain functionals
- Contains interesting philosophical insights but has mathematical gaps that need resolution
- Potential future research direction once mathematical rigor is established

## Status

These materials are **research ideas** rather than validated theory. The main LFT framework remains focused on:
- Constraint counting approach (ValidArrangements/N!)
- Formal verification in Lean 4  
- Computational validation
- Immediate experimental testability

Future work may revisit these extensions once the core framework is fully established and validated.
