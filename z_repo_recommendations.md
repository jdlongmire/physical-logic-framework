# Repository Recommendations — quick evaluation

This document summarizes practical, low-risk recommendations to improve reproducibility, developer experience, and CI for the `physical_logic_framework` repository. It's intentionally concise so you can review and accept/modify changes later.

## 1) Environment & kernels
- Add a top-level `requirements.txt` capturing core Python runtime dependencies used by notebooks and scripts:
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - networkx
  - pandas
  - scipy
  - jupyter
  - ipykernel
  - aiohttp
  - requests

- Create a short `dev/` README section describing how to create and activate a venv and register an ipykernel:
  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  source .venv/Scripts/activate    # Git Bash
  .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1     # PowerShell
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python -m ipykernel install --user --name plf-venv --display-name "PLF (.venv)"
  ```

## 2) Notebook reproducibility
- Standardize notebook outputs folder: create `outputs/` (or keep `/mnt/data/` but document it). Ensure notebooks use `os.path.join('outputs', filename)`.
- Add a smoke-test script or GH Action that executes a small set of notebooks (e.g., 00_Foundations, 01_Ontology_of_I) with `nbconvert --execute` to detect runtime errors.

## 3) Continuous Integration
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow with two jobs:
  1. Python: set up Python, install `requirements.txt`, run unit tests and notebook smoke tests (nbconvert). Cache pip packages.
  2. Lean: install `elan` or use a prebuilt container, set the toolchain from `lean-toolchain`, run `lake build` for core modules (FeasibilityRatio, PermutationGeometry, QuantumBridge).
- Example matrix: ubuntu-latest, python 3.10 or 3.11.

## 4) Lean build and verification
- Commit a minimal `lean/README.md` with exact `elan`/`lake` commands to build proofs and the expected order for modules.
- Add a `lake` build target for a small integration test to be used in CI (e.g., `PhysicalLogicFramework.FeasibilityRatio`).

## 5) LLM bridge & secrets
- Ensure `api_config.json` is NOT committed. Add `api_config.json` to `.gitignore` and add `api_config_template.json` (without keys) for users.
- In CI, provide LLM API keys via repository secrets and an optional masked config step.
- Add retries and rate-limit handling to `claude_llm_bridge.py` if not already present.

## 6) Performance & algorithm improvements
- For `linear_extensions` enumeration:
  - Consider using `networkx.algorithms.dag.all_topological_sorts` for clarity; benchmark against current implementation.
  - Add memoization or prefix-caching to avoid repeated indegree computations.
  - Add a `multiprocessing` option to parallelize exploration over first-level choices.
- For heavy numeric scripts, profile hot loops with `cProfile` and consider `numba` if needed.

## 7) Reproducible environments
- Consider adding one of these:
  - `environment.yml` for conda users
  - `pyproject.toml` + `pip-tools`/`poetry` for pinned dependencies
  - A small `Dockerfile` that installs Python, Jupyter, and Lean (optional) for fully reproducible CI or Binder

## 8) Documentation & onboarding
- Add a short `DEVELOPMENT.md` describing the recommended developer workflow (venv, kernel registration, running notebooks and Lean builds).
- Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` with preferred branches, test expectations, and how to run Lean/Notebook checks locally.

## 9) Quick low-risk edits I can apply for you
- Add `requirements.txt` at repo root (conservative list above).
- Add `z_repo_recommendations.md` (this file) — done.
- Add `.github/workflows/notebooks-and-lean.yml` CI starter (optional next step).

## 10) Next steps you might pick
- I can create and commit `requirements.txt` now.
- I can add a GitHub Actions CI workflow (notebooks smoke test + Lean build).
- I can add a small `Dockerfile` for Binder/CI reproducibility.

Tell me which of the suggested low-risk edits you'd like me to implement and I'll apply them and run quick validation checks.
