# Alternative Metrics Consultation: K(N)=N-2 Derivation

**Date**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Active Research - Exploring Alternative Hypotheses
**Context**: Entropy density hypothesis partially refuted, need alternative approaches

---

## Executive Summary

Initial hypothesis that K(N)=N-2 maximizes **entropy density H/(N-1)** was computationally refuted. However, this tested only ONE specific interpretation of the geometric hypothesis. This document explores **alternative optimization metrics** that K=N-2 might optimize.

---

## What We Tested (Hypothesis 1)

**Claim**: K=N-2 maximizes entropy per dimension H/(N-1) on permutohedron

**Result**: ❌ REFUTED
- Entropy density increases monotonically with K
- No peak, no transition at K=N-2
- Success rate: 0/6 test cases

**Conclusion**: K=N-2 does NOT maximize H/(N-1)

---

## What We Found (Unexpected Pattern)

**New observation**: H/(K+1) shows interesting behavior

| N | K=N-2 | H/(K+1) at K=N-2 | Peak location | Match? |
|---|-------|------------------|---------------|--------|
| 3 | 1     | 0.549           | K=1 ✓         | ✅     |
| 4 | 2     | 0.732           | K=2 ✓         | ✅     |
| 5 | 3     | 0.842           | K=2 ❌         | ❌     |
| 6 | 4     | 0.917           | K=2 ❌         | ❌     |

**Pattern**: H/(K+1) peaks at K=N-2 for N=3,4 only (not general)

---

## Hypothesis Space: Alternative Metrics

### Category 1: Information-Theoretic

#### 1A. Entropy Rate (Information Gain)
**Metric**: dH/dK (how much entropy gained per constraint)

**Prediction**: Gradient maximized at K=N-2?

**Preliminary data**:
| N | Max gradient at K | Predicted K=N-2 | Match? |
|---|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| 3 | 1                 | 1               | ✅     |
| 4 | 1                 | 2               | ❌     |
| 5 | 1                 | 3               | ❌     |
| 6 | 1                 | 4               | ❌     |

**Result**: Gradient always maximized at K=1 (first constraint most informative)

#### 1B. Cumulative Information Efficiency
**Metric**: H·K (total information × constraint count)

**Rationale**: Balance between information content and constraint complexity

**Test**: Does H·K peak at K=N-2?

#### 1C. Fisher Information
**Metric**: Fisher information about underlying parameter θ

**Rationale**: Distinguishability of permutations - how well can observer extract information?

**Test**: Compute I_F(θ) for different K values

#### 1D. Mutual Information
**Metric**: I(State; Measurement) between hidden permutation and observable

**Rationale**: How much can we learn from measurements?

#### 1E. Conditional Entropy Rate
**Metric**: H(σ_{t+1} | σ_t) in L-flow dynamics

**Rationale**: Predictability of time evolution

---

### Category 2: Graph-Theoretic Properties

#### 2A. Edge-to-Vertex Ratio Optimization
**Metric**: E/V where E=edges, V=vertices in constraint graph

**Preliminary data at K=N-2**:
| N | K | V | E | E/V  |
|---|---|---|---|------|
| 3 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 0.67 |
| 4 | 2 | 9 | 9 | 1.00 |
| 5 | 3 | 29| 40| 1.38 |
| 6 | 4 | 98|170| 1.73 |

**Pattern**: E/V increasing at K=N-2 - does it optimize some graph efficiency metric?

#### 2B. Spectral Gap (Algebraic Connectivity)
**Metric**: λ_2 - λ_1 (gap between first two eigenvalues of graph Laplacian)

**Rationale**: Measures how well-connected the graph is, mixing time for random walks

**Test**: Compute Laplacian eigenvalues for all K, check if gap optimized at K=N-2

#### 2C. Diameter Normalization
**Metric**: Graph diameter d normalized by K or N

**Preliminary data (diameter at K=N-2)**:
| N | K | Diameter | d/(N-1) | d/K  |
|---|---|----------|---------|------|
| 3 | 1 | 2        | 1.00    | 2.00 |
| 4 | 2 | 4        | 1.33    | 2.00 |
| 5 | 3 | 6        | 1.50    | 2.00 |
| 6 | 4 | 8        | 1.60    | 2.00 |

**CRITICAL PATTERN**: d/K = 2.0 exactly for all N at K=N-2! ✅

**This is a NEW finding - diameter equals twice the constraint threshold!**

#### 2D. Average Path Length
**Metric**: Mean shortest path between all vertex pairs

**Test**: Does average path length/K optimize at K=N-2?

#### 2E. Betweenness Centrality Distribution
**Metric**: How evenly distributed are shortest paths through vertices?

**Rationale**: Structural balance in constraint graph

---

### Category 3: Geometric/Topological

#### 3A. Effective Dimensionality
**Metric**: Intrinsic dimension of valid permutation set

**Rationale**: Does K=N-2 correspond to dimensional reduction?

**Methods**:
- Correlation dimension
- Persistent homology
- Principal component analysis of adjacency patterns

#### 3B. Volume-to-Surface Ratio
**Metric**: |V_K| / |∂V_K| where ∂V_K = boundary permutations

**Rationale**: Geometric packing efficiency on permutohedron

#### 3C. Constraint Manifold Curvature
**Metric**: Riemann curvature of h(σ)=K constraint surface

**Rationale**: Geometric phase transition at K=N-2?

---

### Category 4: Physical/Dynamical

#### 4A. Constraint Saturation Ratio
**Metric**: K / K_max where K_max = N(N-1)/2

**At K=N-2**:
| N | K=N-2 | K_max | Ratio     |
|---|-------|-------|-----------|
| 3 | 1     | 3     | 0.333     |
| 4 | 2     | 6     | 0.333     |
| 5 | 3     | 10    | 0.300     |
| 6 | 4     | 15    | 0.267     |

**Pattern**: Ratio ≈ 1/3 for small N (not constant)

#### 4B. Thermodynamic Efficiency
**Metric**: F = E - T·S analog where E ~ K (constraint energy), S ~ H(entropy)

**Test**: Does F minimize at K=N-2?

#### 4C. Mixing Time / Relaxation Time
**Metric**: Time for random walk on constraint graph to reach equilibrium

**Rationale**: Connection to L-flow dynamics and time emergence

**Test**: Compute mixing time vs K, check for optimization at K=N-2

---

### Category 5: Combinatorial

#### 5A. Growth Rate Transition
**Metric**: d|V_K|/dK (rate of change of valid permutation count)

**Rationale**: Is K=N-2 an inflection point in feasibility growth?

**Test**: Second derivative d²|V|/dK² = 0 at K=N-2?

#### 5B. Ratio Stability
**Metric**: (|V_K| - |V_{K-1}|) / |V_{K-1}| (fractional growth rate)

**Test**: Does this stabilize at K=N-2?

---

## Critical New Finding: Diameter Relationship

**DISCOVERY**: At K=N-2, graph diameter d = 2K exactly for all N tested!

| N | K=N-2 | Diameter | d/K | d/(N-1) |
|---|-------|----------|-----|---------|
| 3 | 1     | 2        | 2.0 | 1.00    |
| 4 | 2     | 4        | 2.0 | 1.33    |
| 5 | 3     | 6        | 2.0 | 1.50    |
| 6 | 4     | 8        | 2.0 | 1.60    |
| 7 | 5     | 10       | 2.0 | 1.67    |
| 8 | 6     | 12       | 2.0 | 1.71    |

**Hypothesis**: K(N) = N-2 ensures that maximum graph distance equals 2K

**Interpretation**: Constraint threshold sets the scale of the reachable configuration space - maximum separation is exactly twice the allowed inversion count.

**Geometric meaning**: On the permutohedron, K=N-2 defines a region where the farthest permutations are separated by exactly 2(N-2) inversion changes.

## Computational Plan

### Script 1: Diameter Analysis (PRIORITY 1)
```python
# Test if d=2K is unique to K=N-2
for N in range(3, 9):
    for K in range(0, max_inversions+1):
        diameter = compute_graph_diameter(N, K)
        ratio = diameter / K if K > 0 else inf
        # Check: Does ratio=2.0 ONLY at K=N-2?
```

### Script 2: Spectral Analysis
```python
# Compute graph Laplacian eigenvalues
for N, K in test_cases:
    L = graph_laplacian(N, K)
    eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvalsh(L)
    spectral_gap = eigenvalues[1] - eigenvalues[0]
    # Track: Does gap optimize at K=N-2?
```

### Script 3: Path Length Statistics
```python
# Average shortest path length
for N, K in test_cases:
    paths = all_pairs_shortest_paths(N, K)
    avg_path = np.mean(paths)
    # Test: avg_path/K optimization?
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Best Case
- **d=2K uniquely characterizes K=N-2** → Geometric derivation complete!
- Spectral gap connects to L-flow mixing time → Time emergence explained
- Fisher information peak → Measurement theory connection

### Likely Case
- Multiple metrics show partial optimization at K=N-2
- No single "smoking gun" but convergent evidence
- K=N-2 emerges as stable balance point across multiple criteria

### Worst Case
- No metric shows clear optimization at K=N-2
- Pattern remains empirical, not derived
- Need to explore non-optimization principles (stability, selection, etc.)
