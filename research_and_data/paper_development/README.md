# Paper Development Artifacts

This directory contains research and development artifacts from the LFT paper revision process (2025-01-03).

## Contents

### `consultations/`

Multi-LLM expert consultations on critical paper sections:
- **born_rule_consultation**: Expert analysis of Born rule derivation claims
- **i2ps_formalization_consultation**: Rigorous I2PS measure theory formalization
- **spacetime_emergence_consultation**: Spacetime emergence challenges and gaps

Each consultation includes:
- `.json`: Query and metadata
- `_output.txt`: Full expert responses

### `revision_plans/`

Revision plans based on expert feedback:
- **COMPREHENSIVE_REVISION_PLAN.md**: Master revision plan (Tier 1-3)
- **BORN_RULE_ANALYSIS_GEMINI.md**: Born rule gaps identified by Gemini-2.0
- **I2PS_FORMALIZATION_GEMINI.md**: Rigorous I2PS formalization from expert
- **SPACETIME_EMERGENCE_ANALYSIS_GEMINI.md**: Spacetime challenges analysis
- **I2PS_LEAN_REVISION_PLAN.md**: Plan for aligning Lean with permutation-based I2PS
- **LEAN_CODE_ANALYSIS.md**: Analysis of Lean codebase structure

### `peer_review/`

Mock peer review materials:
- **PEER_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md**: Summary of peer review consultation
- **PEER_REVIEW_READY.md**: Assessment of publication readiness
- **peer_review_multiLLM.json**: Multi-expert review query
- **peer_review_output.txt**: Full review responses

### Root files

- **It_from_Logic_Scholarly_Paper_PRE_RESTRUCTURE.md**: Paper version before Tier 1 revisions (Oct 3, 2025)

## Context

These artifacts document the critical revision process where the paper was transformed from overclaiming to scientifically honest framing:

**Before**: Claimed full derivation of Born rule and spacetime
**After**: Honest framework with verified cases (N=3, N=4) and identified gaps

**Major accomplishments**:
1. Rigorous I2PS formalization (∏ Sₙ with measure theory)
2. Honest Born rule framing (framework + verified cases, not general derivation)
3. Honest spacetime framing (research program, not completed derivation)
4. Identification of critical gaps (amplitude hypothesis, Lorentz invariance)

**Outcome**: Paper suitable for Foundations of Physics (~60-70% acceptance probability before amplitude breakthrough)
