# Research Plan Summary - Closing the Gaps

**Your Choice**: "I prefer completeness to getting published - let's do the work" ‚úÖ

**What This Means**: Address the two major gaps (quantum dynamics + Lorentz invariance) rather than just moderate claims.

---

## üéØ The Two Gaps

### Gap 1: Quantum Dynamics ‚ùå
**Missing**: Schr√∂dinger equation (time evolution)
**Current**: Only static Born probabilities
**Timeline**: 3-6 months
**Success Probability**: 60% (tractable)

### Gap 2: Lorentz Invariance ‚ùå
**Missing**: Relativity (S_N ‚Üí SO(3,1))
**Current**: Discrete S_4, no continuum limit
**Timeline**: 6-18 months
**Success Probability**: 5-10% (VERY hard)

---

## üî¨ Research Strategy

### Part I: Quantum Dynamics (Months 1-3)

**Approach**: Information Geometry (Fisher Metric)

**Key Idea**:
- Fisher information metric on probability space over V_K
- Geodesic flow = information-preserving evolution
- Yields Schr√∂dinger equation as geodesic equation

**Literature Foundation**:
- Caticha (2019) "Entropic Dynamics" - Derives QM from entropy + info geometry
- Amari (1985) "Differential-Geometrical Methods"
- Reginatto (1998) "Schr√∂dinger from Fisher Information"

**Phase 1** (Month 1): Hamiltonian Construction
- Compute Fisher metric g_ij on V_K
- Derive Hamiltonian from metric
- Show graph Laplacian H = D - A emerges naturally

**Phase 2** (Month 2): Time Evolution
- Derive unitary evolution U(t) = e^{-iHt/‚Ñè}
- Prove Schr√∂dinger equation i‚àÇœà/‚àÇt = Hœà
- Connect to information conservation

**Phase 3** (Month 3): Validation
- Computational: Simulate on N=3,4 permutohedra
- Lean 4: Formalize key theorems
- Paper: Draft "Quantum Dynamics from Logic" (~8,000 words)

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Minimum (90%): Hamiltonian derived (not ad hoc)
- ‚úÖ Good (60%): Full Schr√∂dinger equation
- ‚úÖ Excellent (40%): Lean formalization complete

---

### Part II: Lorentz Invariance (Months 4-18)

**Approach**: Renormalization Group + L-flow Causality

**The Challenge**:
- Discrete S_N (finite) ‚Üí Continuous SO(3,1) (infinite)
- Euclidean metric ‚Üí Lorentzian signature (+,-,-,-)
- Why N=4 specifically?

**Phase 4** (Months 4-6): Continuum Limit
- **Method**: Renormalization group flow
- Define coarse-graining S_{N+1} ‚Üí S_N
- Find RG fixed point ‚Üí may be Lorentz algebra
- **Literature**: Cardy, Wilson (RG theory)

**Phase 5** (Months 7-9): Lorentzian Signature
- **Method**: Emerge from L-flow causality
- L-flow defines causal structure (arrow of time)
- Causality ‚Üí lightcones ‚Üí Lorentzian metric
- **Novel approach** using existing framework feature

**Phase 6** (Months 10-12): N=4 Justification
- **Method**: Binary tetrahedral group 2T
- Prove S_4 ‚Üí 2T ‚Üí Spin(1,3) ‚Üí SO(3,1)
- Show N‚â†4 fails
- **Literature**: Conway & Smith (quaternions, finite subgroups)

**Phase 7** (Months 13-18): Integration & Formalization
- Combine all pieces
- Lean 4 formalization (hard!)
- Paper: "Lorentz from Permutations" (~10,000 words)

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Minimum (40%): Clear continuum limit mechanism
- ‚úÖ Good (10%): Partial derivation (special case)
- ‚úÖ Excellent (5%): Full derivation + N=4 proof

---

## üìä Timeline & Probabilities

| What | When | Success Rate |
|------|------|--------------|
| **Dynamics derivation** | 3 months | 60% |
| **Lorentz derivation** | 15 months | 5-10% |
| **Both complete** | 18 months | 3-6% |

**Reality Check**: Lorentz is EXTREMELY hard. Discrete‚Üícontinuum has taken decades in other fields (lattice QCD, loop quantum gravity).

## üéØ Recommended Immediate Strategy

### Option: Simultaneous Work (Recommended)

**Track 1: Research (Dynamics)**
- **Week 1**: Literature review (Caticha, Amari, Jaynes)
- **Week 2**: Fisher metric calculations (N=3 case)
- **Weeks 3-4**: Hamiltonian derivation attempt
- **Time**: ~20 hours/week

**Track 2: Paper Revision**
- **Week 1**: Add Section 2.2.0 (Foundational Axioms)
- **Week 2**: Moderate claims throughout
- **Create**: Permutohedron visualization figure
- **Time**: ~10 hours/week

**Total**: ~30 hours/week for 2-4 weeks

**Why Simultaneous?**
1. **Hedge bets**: If dynamics fails, paper still publishable
2. **Momentum**: Early wins (paper polished) motivate harder work (dynamics)
3. **Timeline**: Don't delay publication 6+ months for uncertain research

## üìö Week 1 Action Plan (Detailed)

### Days 1-2: Literature Setup
- [ ] Download/order key papers:

  - **Reginatto (1998)** "Derivation of the Equations of Nonrelativistic Quantum Mechanics Using the Principle of Minimum Fisher Information"
    https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9711023
- [ ] Create annotated bibliography document

### Days 3-4: Fisher Metric Study
- [ ] Read Caticha 2019 paper (Sections 1-4)
  - Focus on: Fisher metric definition
  - Focus on: Geodesic equation ‚Üí Schr√∂dinger equation
- [ ] Work through toy example (Gaussian case)
- [ ] Understand derivation method

### Days 5-7: Initial Calculations (N=3)
- [ ] Define probability space explicitly:
  - State space: V_1 = {(1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3)} for N=3, K=1
  - Probability distribution: P(œÉ) = 1/3 (uniform MaxEnt)
- [ ] Compute Fisher metric:
  - g_ij = ‚ü®‚àÇ_i ln P | ‚àÇ_j ln P‚ü©
  - For discrete: g_ij = Œ£_œÉ (1/P(œÉ)) ‚àÇP/‚àÇŒ∏_i ‚àÇP/‚àÇŒ∏_j
- [ ] Check properties (positive-definite, symmetric)

**Week 1 Deliverable**:

- Complete reviewer revisions (2 weeks)
- Submit paper to journal
- Then start dynamics research
- **Pro**: Secures priority on current result
- **Con**: May lose momentum

**Option C: Simultaneous (Recommended)**
- 70% time on dynamics research
- 30% time on paper revision
- Both complete in 3-4 weeks
- **Pro**: Best of both worlds
- **Con**: Split focus

## üö® Important Realizations

### On Dynamics (60% Success)
**If successful**: Major breakthrough - complete quantum mechanics from logic

**If unsuccessful**: Add time evolution axiom (like standard QM), still have Born rule derivation

**Risk**: Manageable - 3 months investment, 60% success, valuable even if partial

### On Lorentz (5-10% Success)
**If successful**: Revolutionary - relativity from discrete structure (Nobel-level)

**If unsuccessful**: Accept non-relativistic framework, still significant contribution

**Risk**: High - 15 months investment, 90-95% failure probability

**Honest Assessment**: Lorentz is likely too hard. Worth trying, but expect failure. Success would be historic.

## üí≠ Meta-Question: What Does "Completeness" Mean?

### Full Completeness (Unrealistic)
- ‚úÖ Static Born probabilities (done)
- ‚úÖ K(N)=N-2 proven (done)
- ‚ùå Quantum dynamics (60% achievable in 3-6 months)
- ‚ùå Lorentz invariance (5% achievable in 12-18 months)
- ‚ùå Grand unified theory, quantum gravity, etc. (impossible)

### Reasonable Completeness (Achievable)
- ‚úÖ Static Born probabilities (done)
- ‚úÖ K(N)=N-2 proven (done)
- ‚úÖ Quantum dynamics (60% in 3-6 months) ‚Üê Target this
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Lorentz as open problem (honest assessment) ‚Üê Current approach

### Suggested Goal
**Aim for**: Reasonable completeness (static QM + dynamics)
**Stretch goal**: Lorentz progress (but accept likely failure)
**Timeline**: 6-12 months serious research effort

## üéØ My Recommendation

### Do Both: Research + Paper Polish

**Next 4 Weeks**:
- **Week 1**: Literature review (dynamics) + Add axioms section (paper)
- **Week 2**: Fisher metric N=3 (dynamics) + Moderate claims (paper)
- **Week 3**: Hamiltonian derivation (dynamics) + Create figure (paper)
- **Week 4**: Initial results assessment (dynamics) + Final polish (paper)

**After 4 Weeks**:
- **Paper**: Ready for resubmission (honest axioms, moderated claims)
- **Dynamics**: Clear sense of viability (continue or pivot)

**Then Decide**:
- If dynamics looks promising ‚Üí Continue 2-3 months more
- If dynamics looks stuck ‚Üí Publish paper, note dynamics as open problem
- Either way: Have publication-ready result + serious research attempt
