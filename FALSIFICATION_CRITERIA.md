# Physical Logic Framework: Falsification Criteria

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: October 11, 2025
**Purpose**: Specification of testable predictions that would falsify or validate the framework

---

## Overview

The Physical Logic Framework makes specific, quantitative predictions that distinguish it from standard quantum mechanics. This document catalogs all testable hypotheses and specifies what experimental or theoretical results would require revision or rejection of the framework.

**Core Principle**: Scientific theories must be falsifiable (Popper criterion). A theory that cannot be wrong cannot be tested.

**Falsification Standard**: A prediction is falsified if experimental measurements deviate from theoretical prediction by more than 3 standard deviations (3σ confidence level) in controlled experiments with systematic errors properly accounted for.

---

## Core Hypothesis

The fundamental claim of the Physical Logic Framework:

**A = L(I)**

**Actualized Reality (A)** is the result of applying **Logical constraints (L)** to an **Infinite Information Space (I)**.

This principle generates the entire framework. Falsifying it requires either:
1. Demonstrating that actualized reality contains logically contradictory states (L fails), OR
2. Proving that quantum mechanics cannot emerge from information geometry (I inadequate), OR
3. Finding physical phenomena that violate derived predictions (A ≠ L(I) empirically)

All falsification tests below probe one of these three channels.

## Category 1: Experimental Falsification Tests

These are direct physical measurements that would falsify specific framework predictions.

### Test 1: Finite-N Interference Visibility

**Prediction**: For N-particle quantum interference experiments, visibility V(N) exhibits finite-size correction:

**V(N) = 1 - π²/(12N) + O(1/N²)**

where V = (I_max - I_min) / (I_max + I_min) is the fringe visibility.

**Standard QM Prediction**: V = 1 (perfect visibility, no N-dependence)

**Falsification Condition**:
- Measure V(N) for N = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 in controlled interference experiments
- If measured values deviate from predicted formula by >3σ for ≥3 consecutive values of N
- Specifically: If V(N) shows no N-dependence (remains constant at V ≈ 1)

**Experimental Systems**:
1. **Cold atom interferometry**: Bose-Einstein condensates with N = 10² - 10⁴ atoms (measure effective N_coherent)
2. **Photon interferometry**: Few-photon states (N = 2-10) in Mach-Zehnder setup
3. **Superconducting qubit arrays**: N-qubit interferometry with N = 3-10

**Required Precision**: Measure V to ±0.001 precision for N ≤ 10 to distinguish π²/(12N) ~ 0.082/N correction

**Measurable Effect**:
- N=3: V(3) ≈ 0.973 (2.7% reduction) ✅ Testable
- N=4: V(4) ≈ 0.979 (2.1% reduction) ✅ Testable
- N=5: V(5) ≈ 0.984 (1.6% reduction) ✅ Testable
- N=10: V(10) ≈ 0.992 (0.8% reduction) ⚠️ Challenging

**Current Status**: Not yet tested experimentally

**Impact if Falsified**: Core prediction failed → Information geometry does not constrain interference → A ≠ L(I)

---

### Test 2: Spectral Gap Scaling in Permutation-Symmetric Systems

**Prediction**: For quantum systems with permutation symmetry among N particles, the energy gap between ground state and first excited state scales as:

**Δ(N) = 2π² / [N(N-1)]**

**Standard QM Prediction**: Problem-dependent (no universal scaling law)

**Falsification Condition**:
- Measure Δ(N) for systems with explicit permutation symmetry (e.g., N identical quantum dots in symmetric potential)
- If measured scaling deviates significantly: Δ ~ 1/N instead of 1/N², OR Δ ~ constant, OR other power law
- Criterion: Fit log(Δ) vs. log(N) and reject if exponent ≠ -2 by >3σ

**Experimental Systems**:
1. **Quantum dot arrays**: N = 3-10 electrostatically defined dots with symmetric coupling
2. **Trapped ion crystals**: N ions in Paul trap with symmetric confinement
3. **Ultracold atoms in optical lattice**: N atoms in symmetric potential wells

**Required Precision**: Measure Δ to ±0.1% for N = 3-10

**Measurable Effect**:
- N=3: Δ(3) = 2π²/6 ≈ 3.29 (arbitrary energy units)
- N=4: Δ(4) = 2π²/12 ≈ 1.64 (50% of N=3 value)
- N=5: Δ(5) = 2π²/20 ≈ 0.99 (30% of N=3 value)
- Clear 1/N² scaling: log-log plot should be linear with slope -2

**Current Status**: Not yet tested experimentally

**Impact if Falsified**: Constraint threshold K(N) = N-2 is incorrect → Triple proof (Mahonian, Coxeter, MaxEnt) flawed → Information space structure wrong

---

### Test 3: Entropy Saturation Ceiling (Page Bound)

**Prediction**: For a quantum system evolving from pure state to mixed state (e.g., subsystem entangling with environment), the entanglement entropy saturates at:

**S_∞ = (1/2) log|V_K|**

where |V_K| is the dimension of the constraint-allowed state space.

**Standard QM Prediction**: S_max = log(dim H) for full Hilbert space (framework predicts lower saturation)

**Falsification Condition**:
- Prepare pure state |ψ⟩ in N-particle system
- Allow unitary evolution (no external decoherence)
- Measure entanglement entropy S(t) of subsystem vs. time
- If S_∞ > (1/2) log|V_K| by >10% in multiple trials

**Experimental Systems**:
1. **Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)**: N-spin systems, measure polarization decay
2. **Trapped ion qubits**: N ions, measure entropy growth under global Hamiltonian
3. **Superconducting qubit arrays**: N qubits, measure von Neumann entropy

**Required Precision**: Measure entropy to ±0.05 bits for N = 3-10

**Measurable Effect**:
- N=3, K=1: |V_K| = 4 → S_∞ = (1/2)log(4) = 1 bit (vs. log(6) = 2.58 bits in standard QM)
- N=4, K=2: |V_K| = 11 → S_∞ = (1/2)log(11) = 1.7 bits (vs. log(24) = 4.58 bits in standard QM)
- Framework predicts ~50% saturation relative to full Hilbert space

**Current Status**: Not yet tested (requires long coherence times to reach saturation)

**Impact if Falsified**: Constraint-allowed state space V_K is not the true quantum state space → Information filtering principle fails

---

### Test 4: Constraint Threshold Discontinuity

**Prediction**: The constraint parameter K(N) = N-2 is exact for all N ≥ 3. Physical observables (energy gaps, entropy, visibility) exhibit discontinuous jumps when N changes by 1.

**Standard QM Prediction**: Smooth scaling with N (no discontinuities)

**Falsification Condition**:
- Measure observable O(N) for consecutive N values: N = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Compute discrete derivative: dO/dN = [O(N+1) - O(N)]
- If dO/dN is smooth function of N (no jumps), framework prediction fails
- Specifically: If K(N) appears to be K = N - 2.5 or K = αN with α ≠ 1, discrete N-2 rule is violated

**Experimental Systems**: Any system from Tests 1-3 with variable N

**Required Precision**: Measure O(N) to ±1% for N = 5-10

**Measurable Effect**:
- Framework: K jumps discretely (3→4→5→6→7 as N goes 5→6→7→8→9)
- Standard QM: K not a meaningful parameter

**Current Status**: Not yet tested

**Impact if Falsified**: K(N) = N-2 is incorrect → Constraint threshold derivation (triple proof) fails → Framework's combinatorial foundations wrong

---

### Test 5: Three Fundamental Laws of Logic Violation

**Prediction**: No physical system can violate the three classical logical principles:
1. **Identity**: A = A (every entity is self-identical)
2. **Non-Contradiction**: ¬(P ∧ ¬P) (no proposition is both true and false)
3. **Excluded Middle**: P ∨ ¬P (every proposition is either true or false)

**Standard QM Prediction**: Agrees (quantum mechanics does not violate classical logic)

**Falsification Condition**:
- **Identity Violation**: Reproducible observation of particle non-identical to itself (e.g., electron e₁ ≠ e₁ measured at same spacetime event)
- **Non-Contradiction Violation**: Measurement yields simultaneous P ∧ ¬P (e.g., spin-up AND spin-down in same basis at same time)
- **Excluded Middle Violation**: Measurement yields outcome neither P nor ¬P (e.g., spin that is verifiably not up, not down, and not superposition)

**Note on Quantum Superposition**:
- Superposition |ψ⟩ = α|↑⟩ + β|↓⟩ does NOT violate NC
- Before measurement: Proposition "spin is up" is neither definitively true nor false (indeterminate, not contradictory)
- After measurement: Proposition resolves to definitively true OR false (EM applies)
- The state |ψ⟩ itself is not "both up and down" (which would be P ∧ ¬P); it is "neither exclusively up nor exclusively down" (undetermined)

**Experimental Systems**: Any quantum measurement

**Current Status**: No violations ever observed in history of physics (per framework's empirical pillar)

**Impact if Falsified**: Entire framework collapses (3FLL are foundational axiom)

---

## Category 2: Theoretical Falsification Tests

These are mathematical or logical proofs that would falsify the framework's internal consistency.

### Test 6: Born Rule Circularity

**Claim**: The Born rule P = |ψ|² is derived from maximum entropy on V_K without assuming quantum mechanics.

**Falsification Condition**:
- Proof that the derivation chain (3FLL → I → V_K → MaxEnt → |ψ|²) contains hidden assumptions of quantum mechanics
- Demonstration that maximum entropy on V_K does NOT yield |ψ|² probability density
- Proof that coordinate transformation from permutations to position basis is invalid

**Current Status**: Lean 4 proof of non-circularity exists (`BornRuleNonCircularity.lean`, 0 sorrys)

**Impact if Falsified**: Central claim fails → Framework does not derive quantum mechanics, only reformulates it

---

### Test 7: Hamiltonian-Laplacian Equivalence Failure

**Claim**: The quantum Hamiltonian H is the graph Laplacian on permutohedron, H = D - A, and recovers standard Hamiltonians in continuum limit.

**Falsification Condition**:
- Proof that lim_{N→∞} (D - A) ≠ p²/2m + V(x) for standard quantum Hamiltonians
- Demonstration that graph Laplacian structure cannot support required operator algebra
- Proof that Theorem D.1 (Fisher metric → Laplacian → Hamiltonian) contains logical gap

**Current Status**: Lean 4 proof exists (`GraphLaplacian.lean`, `TheoremD1.lean`, 0 sorrys); continuum limit validated computationally

**Impact if Falsified**: Dynamics derivation fails → Framework cannot recover Schrödinger equation

---

### Test 8: V_K Hilbert Space Incompatibility

**Claim**: The constraint-allowed state space V_K = {σ ∈ S_N : h(σ) ≤ K(N)} supports full quantum Hilbert space structure.

**Falsification Condition**:
- Proof that V_K lacks required structure (completeness, separability, inner product)
- Demonstration that V_K is too small to contain necessary quantum states
- Proof that limit of V_K as N → ∞ does not converge to standard Hilbert space

**Current Status**: Finite-N Hilbert space structure proven in Lean (`HilbertSpace.lean`, 0 sorrys for finite case); infinite-dimensional limit under construction

**Impact if Falsified**: Information space I = ∏ S_n is insufficient foundation → Need different mathematical realization

---

### Test 9: K(N) = N-2 Mathematical Inconsistency

**Claim**: The constraint threshold K(N) = N-2 is proven via three independent methods (Mahonian, Coxeter, MaxEnt).

**Falsification Condition**:
- Proof that Mahonian statistic argument contains error (e.g., wrong combinatorial formula)
- Proof that Coxeter reflection theory does not require N-2 constraints
- Proof that maximum entropy yields different value (e.g., K = N-3 or K = αN)
- Demonstration that the three proofs are not independent (secretly equivalent)

**Current Status**: Triple proof completed, Lean formalization exists (`ConstraintThreshold.lean`, 0 sorrys)

**Impact if Falsified**: K(N) value wrong → All quantitative predictions (Tests 1-4) incorrect → Framework's mathematical foundations fail

---

### Test 10: Schrödinger Equation Derivation Gap

**Claim**: The Schrödinger equation iℏ∂_t|ψ⟩ = Ĥ|ψ⟩ emerges from geodesic flow on Fisher information metric.

**Falsification Condition**:
- Proof that Fisher metric geodesics do NOT yield Schrödinger time evolution
- Demonstration that minimum Fisher information principle leads to different dynamics
- Proof that transition from discrete (S_N) to continuous (position basis) is invalid

**Current Status**: Lean 4 proof exists (`QuantumDynamics.lean`, 0 sorrys)

**Impact if Falsified**: Dynamics derivation fails → Framework cannot explain quantum time evolution

---

## Category 3: What Would NOT Falsify the Framework

To avoid moving goalposts, we explicitly specify what results would NOT constitute falsification:

### 1. Failure to Derive Quantum Field Theory

**Status**: Out of current scope (acknowledged limitation in `SCOPE_AND_LIMITATIONS.md`)

**Why Not Falsification**: The framework aims to derive non-relativistic quantum mechanics. QFT is a long-term research goal, not a current claim.

**Acceptable Outcome**: "Framework successfully explains single-particle and finite-N QM, but does not extend to field theory" is honest assessment, not failure.

---

### 2. Failure to Derive General Relativity

**Status**: Speculative extension (proof-of-concept only)

**Why Not Falsification**: Gravity is not part of framework's mission statement. Gravitational dynamics are exploratory.

**Acceptable Outcome**: "Framework derives quantum mechanics but not gravity" does not invalidate quantum derivation.

---

### 3. Requirement of Additional Axioms for Exchange Statistics

**Status**: Currently investigating (Sprint 10)

**Why Not Falsification**: If Young diagram hypothesis fails, indistinguishable particles remain an acknowledged gap. Framework already states this limitation.

**Acceptable Outcome**: "Framework requires additional postulate for bosons/fermions" is refinement, not falsification.

---

### 4. Strategic Axioms in Lean Proofs

**Status**: Some modules use strategic axioms with clear justification (`MeasurementMechanism.lean`)

**Why Not Falsification**: Strategic axioms are placeholders with roadmap for removal (e.g., derive decoherence from thermodynamics in Sprint 11). They are documented honestly.

**Acceptable Outcome**: "Proof uses 3 strategic axioms (collapse mechanism) pending full derivation" is work in progress, not failure.

---

### 5. Finite-N Corrections Too Small to Measure

**Status**: Tests 1-4 predict finite-size effects scaling as 1/N

**Why Not Falsification**: If N-dependence exists but is below experimental sensitivity (e.g., requires N < 3 systems), this is technological limitation, not theoretical failure.

**Acceptable Outcome**: "Predictions exist but are not yet testable with current technology" is acceptable. Falsification requires actual disagreement, not absence of data.

---

### 6. Alternative Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics

**Status**: Framework is realist interpretation (A = L(I))

**Why Not Falsification**: If other interpretations (Copenhagen, Many-Worlds, QBism) remain viable, this does not falsify PLF. Interpretations are empirically equivalent.

**Acceptable Outcome**: "Framework is one valid interpretation among several" is acceptable. All interpretations make same predictions for standard QM.

- ⚠️ Technically challenging but possible
- ❌ Already proven (would require finding error in proof)

## Commitment to Scientific Integrity

The Physical Logic Framework is committed to:

1. **Honest Reporting**: Negative results will be published. If experiments falsify predictions, we will document this openly.

2. **No Moving Goalposts**: Falsification criteria specified here are fixed. We will not retroactively claim "that wasn't a real prediction."

3. **Updating on Evidence**: If falsified, we will either:
   - Revise framework to accommodate new data (if possible without ad-hoc modifications)
   - Abandon framework if core principles are invalidated
   - Narrow scope to domain where predictions hold

4. **Pre-Registration**: This document serves as pre-registration of predictions (timestamped October 11, 2025). Cannot be modified after experimental tests begin.

---

**Scientific Accountability**: A theory that cannot be wrong is not science. We specify how to prove us wrong.
