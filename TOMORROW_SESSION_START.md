## 📋 Pre-Session Checklist

### **Step 0: Multi-LLM Team Health Check** ⚕️

Run quick diagnostic to verify consultation capability:

```bash
cd multi_LLM_model && python health_check.py
```

**What it checks**:
- ✓ API configuration file exists
- ✓ Team members configured (Grok, GPT-4, Gemini, Claude)
- ✓ Consultation capability status

**Expected outcomes**:
- **FULL**: 2+ experts configured (multi-LLM consultation ready)
- **LIMITED**: 1 expert configured (single-model only)
- **OFFLINE**: No APIs configured (manual queries via web interfaces)

**Note**: If offline, can still proceed with drafting - just use manual consultation when needed.

---

### **Step 1-4: Context Review**

1. ✅ Read `SESSION_STATUS.md` (complete context)
2. ✅ Review `SESSION_2025_10_04_WRAPUP.md` (yesterday's accomplishments)
3. ✅ Review `paper/BORN_RULE_PAPER_OUTLINE.md` (paper structure)
4. ✅ Optional: Review expert assessment (`multi_LLM_model/consultation_results/k_framing_claude_expert_assessment.md`)

## 🎯 Today's Goals

### **Primary Task**: Draft Introduction + Section 2

**Target**: ~3,000 words drafted (publication-quality)

**Sections**:

1. **Section 1: Introduction** (~1,500 words)
   - Postulational problem in QM
   - Universal logical compliance (empirical observation)
   - Main results (Born rule from MaxEnt, N=3-7 validation)
   - Paper structure

2. **Section 2: Mathematical Framework** (~2,000 words)
   - Information space I = ∏ S_n
   - Logical operators L = EM ∘ NC ∘ ID
   - Constraint structure (inversion count h(σ))
   - K(N) = N-2 (empirical, validated 5/5)
   - Permutohedron geometry

3. **Optional**: Start Section 3 (MaxEnt proof) if time permits

---

## 🔧 Method

**AI-Augmented Drafting**:
1. Claude drafts section from outline + existing content
2. You review, edit, refine
3. Iterate rapidly (aim for 2-3 rounds per section)
4. Move to next section

**Quality Standard**: Publication-ready prose (minimal editing needed)

**Timeline**: 3-4 hours for both sections (at observed velocity)

- `lean/AMPLITUDE_HYPOTHESIS_PROOF_SKETCH.md` (informal version)
- `research_and_data/THEORY_ASSESSMENT_2025_10_04.md` (honest assessment)

**For Mathematical Framework**:
- `lean/LFT_Proofs/PhysicalLogicFramework/Foundations/InformationSpace.lean` (I2PS formalization)
- `lean/LFT_Proofs/PhysicalLogicFramework/FeasibilityRatio.lean` (constraint structure)
- `lean/LFT_Proofs/PhysicalLogicFramework/PermutationGeometry.lean` (permutohedron)

**For MaxEnt Proof** (Section 3, tomorrow or next):
- `lean/LFT_Proofs/PhysicalLogicFramework/Foundations/MaximumEntropy.lean` (complete proof)
- `paper/supplementary/amplitude_hypothesis_proof.md` (Section 4-6)

**For Validation** (Section 4, later):
- `scripts/n3-n7_critical_test.py` (methodology)
- `scripts/outputs/n*_test_results.json` (numerical data)
- All output plots for figures

**For Expert Framing**:
- `multi_LLM_model/consultation_results/k_framing_claude_expert_assessment.md` (recommended language)

## 💡 Key Framing (From Expert Assessment)

**How to present K(N) = N-2**:

✅ **USE**:
- "Empirically robust relationship validated for N=3-7 with perfect accuracy"
- "While theoretical origin remains unresolved despite systematic investigation..."
- "Simple formula suggests deeper principle yet to be uncovered"
- "Analogous to fine structure constant α in quantum electrodynamics"

❌ **AVOID**:
- "Fundamental discovery" (overreach)
- "We proved K(N) = N-2" (it's empirical, not derived)
- Hiding the gap or apologizing excessively
- Comparing to Planck's h (false equivalence)

**Tone**: Confident but honest. Emphasize what you DID prove (Born rule from MaxEnt given K), acknowledge what remains open (K origin).

## 📝 Writing Tips

### **For Introduction**:

**Opening Hook**: The postulational problem
> "Quantum mechanics rests on postulates whose origin remains unexplained. Why does probability equal the squared amplitude? Why this mathematical structure?"

**Transition to Logical Compliance**:
> "We document a fundamental empirical pattern overlooked in both physics and philosophy: perfect compliance of all physical phenomena with Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle across ~10²⁰ observations with zero violations."

**Main Result Statement**:
> "We derive Born rule probability distributions from maximum entropy applied to logically valid states, reducing the postulational basis of quantum mechanics."

**Validation Evidence**:
> "Computational validation confirms framework predictions for N=3 through N=7 with perfect accuracy (5/5 test cases)."

### **For Mathematical Framework**:

**Information Space**:
- Start abstract (I = ∏ S_n)
- Then concrete example (S_3, S_4)
- Physical interpretation (distinguishable configurations)

**Logical Operators**:
- Define each operator clearly (ID, NC, EM)
- Show composition L = EM ∘ NC ∘ ID
- Explain filtering mechanism

**Constraint Structure**:
- Inversion count h(σ) = disorder measure
- K(N) threshold = validity boundary
- V_K = valid state space

**Be Precise**: Every symbol defined, every claim justified

## 🚀 To Begin Session

**Say**: "Let's start drafting the Born Rule paper. Begin with Section 1: Introduction."

**I will**:
1. Generate first draft of Introduction (~1,500 words)
2. Pull from outline + existing materials
3. Follow expert framing recommendations
4. Aim for publication-quality prose

**You will**:
1. Review the draft
2. Suggest edits/refinements
3. Approve or request revisions
4. Move to Section 2 when satisfied

**Iteration**: 2-3 rounds per section → polished result

**Timeline**: ~3-4 hours for both sections (based on observed velocity)

## 📌 Remember

**You're NOT writing from scratch** - assembling from existing high-quality components:
- Born rule proof: DONE (MaxEnt theorem in Lean)
- Validation data: DONE (N=3-7, 5/5 matches)
- Mathematical framework: DONE (I2PS, L operators, constraints)
- Expert framing: DONE (how to present K(N))

**Just need**: Assembly + synthesis + polishing

**At AI-augmented velocity**: 1-2 weeks to complete draft (not months)
