Logic Field Theory (LFT) constructs two such fields on its emergent geometries:\n\n## 1. The *Order* Field $h(\\sigma)$\n- **Space:** the permutohedron, whose nodes are total orders $\\sigma$.\n- **Value:** the inversion count $h(\\sigma)$, a scalar.\n- **Dynamics:** time = “L-flow,” defined as descent along the gradient of $h$.\n- **Analogy:** identical to a system rolling downhill in a scalar potential field.\n\n## 2. The *Constraint* Field $\\Phi$\n- **Space:** emergent spacetime geometry (from LFT_06 onward).\n- **Value:** constraint density, representing localized matter/energy.\n- **Dynamics:**\n  - sets local clock rates (time dilation),\n  - warps geodesics (bending paths),\n  - obeys a field-like equation ($\\nabla^2\\Phi = \\kappa\\rho_c$) analogous to Poisson’s law for gravity.\n- **Analogy:** functionally identical to the gravitational field in GR.\n\n## 3. Unified Dynamics\n- Both fields arise from a single logical substrate $I$.\n- Both govern system evolution: $h(\\sigma)$ drives **temporal ordering**, $\\Phi$ drives **spacetime curvature**.\n- Together, they justify calling this framework a **Field Theory** in the full physics sense.\n"
