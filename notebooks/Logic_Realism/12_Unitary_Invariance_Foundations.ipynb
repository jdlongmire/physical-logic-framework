    "\n",
    "This notebook addresses the most critical concern raised by peer reviewers: **circularity in the Born Rule derivation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three expert reviewers (Grok 0.84/1.0, Gemini 0.58/1.0, ChatGPT 0.52/1.0) identified that our derivation uses \"unitary invariance\" - but isn't this itself a quantum mechanical assumption?\n",

    "**Our Resolution**: We demonstrate that unitary invariance **emerges** from pure combinatorial symmetries and information-theoretic constraints, without assuming Hilbert spaces or quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Claim**: Transformations that preserve (1) combinatorial distances and (2) information entropy on the permutation space S_N are uniquely characterized as unitary operators.\n"

    "## 1. Introduction and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 The Circularity Concern\n",
    "\n",
    "Our original Born Rule derivation proceeded as:\n",
    "\n",
    "**MaxEnt** + **Unitary Invariance** + **K(N)=N-2** → **P(s) = |⟨ψ|s⟩|²**\n",
    "\n",
    "The three peer reviewers all raised the same critical objection:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grok (0.84/1.0)**:\n",
    "> \"The most pressing issue is the potential circularity in the derivation of the Born Rule. The reliance on unitary invariance and other quantum-like assumptions suggests that the framework may not be deriving quantum mechanics from truly independent first principles.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gemini (0.58/1.0)**:\n",
    "> \"The most critical concern is the potential for circularity in the derivation of the Born rule. Carefully examine the assumptions used in the derivation to ensure that they do not implicitly assume the Born rule or any equivalent principle.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT (0.52/1.0)**:\n",
    "> \"The model seems to require a large number of assumptions, some of which are not well motivated... it's not clear why [K(N)=N-2] should be the case.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem**: Unitary transformations are fundamental to quantum mechanics. If we assume unitary invariance, aren't we just assuming quantum structure to derive quantum structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Our Resolution Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "We will show that unitary invariance is **not assumed** but **derived** from principles more fundamental than quantum mechanics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with pure combinatorics**: Symmetric group S_N and permutohedron geometry\n",
    "2. **Identify natural symmetries**: Group operations and adjacency structure (Cayley graph)\n",
    "3. **Impose information-theoretic constraints**: Entropy preservation (MaxEnt), invertibility\n",
    "4. **Show uniqueness**: Only unitary transformations satisfy these combinatorial + information-theoretic constraints\n",
    "5. **Result**: Unitarity emerges from first principles!\n",
