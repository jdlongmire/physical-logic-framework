# Session Log - October 5, 2025 (Continuation)

**Session Type**: File organization + README update
**Date**: October 5, 2025
**Context**: Continuation from Week 2 Day 1 completion

---

## Session Tasks Completed

### 1. File Organization ✅

**CHANGELOG.md archived**:
- Moved `CHANGELOG.md` → `archive/CHANGELOG_archived_2025_10_05.md`
- Reason: File out of date, Session_Log protocol now primary documentation method

**Previous session organization** (from earlier):
- Created `Session_Log/` folder for session documentation
- Moved all session .md files to `Session_Log/`
- Consolidated research files to `research_and_data/` folder
- Moved research plan files to `research_and_data/`

### 2. README.md Update ✅

**Updated to current status** (Week 2 Day 1 complete):

**Key changes**:
1. **Author info**: Updated to "James D. (JD) Longmire, Northrop Grumman Fellow (unaffiliated research)"
2. **Overview**: Changed from "complete framework" to "research in progress" - derives static Born probabilities with dynamics derivation ongoing
3. **Current Status section**: Added Week 2 Day 1 status with dual-track strategy (70% research / 30% paper)
4. **Repository Structure**: Updated to reflect current organization:
   - Session_Log/ folder
   - research_and_data/ folder
   - Paper revision documents (ABSTRACT_MODERATED.md, SECTION_1.1_SCOPE_ADDITION.md, etc.)
5. **Research Progress Summary**: Week 2 Day 1 + Week 1 achievements tables
6. **Peer Review Response**: 4/5 concerns addressed status
7. **Viability Assessment**: 90% dynamics, 95% paper, 5-10% Lorentz
8. **Key Documents Guide**: Links to all current research and paper revision docs
9. **Research Roadmap**: 18-month plan (3 months dynamics, 12-18 months Lorentz)
10. **Citation**: Updated to "Research in progress" (2025)
11. **Current Status Summary**: Completed work + in progress + open problems

**Removed outdated sections**:
- "Complete peer-review ready framework" claims
- Old "Framework Completeness Assessment" tables
- Outdated "Version 2.0" breakthrough achievements

**Overall tone shift**: From "complete publication-ready" → "active research in progress"

## Current Project State

### Week 2 Day 1 Complete ✅
- **Research**: Theorem D.1 formalized (H = D - A from Fisher geometry)
- **Paper**: Abstract + Section 1.1 moderated (honest scoping)
- **Viability**: 90% confidence in dynamics derivation (3-4 months)

### Peer Review Status: 4/5 Concerns Addressed
1. ✅ Logic→Permutation mapping (Section 2.2.0 axioms)
2. ✅ K(N)=N-2 empirical (triple proof)
3. ✅ Overclaiming scope (moderated throughout)
4. ✅ Hamiltonian ad hoc (Theorem D.1 derivation)
5. ⏳ Section 7 limitations (pending)

## Next Steps

### Day 2 Tasks (per WEEK2_DAY1_SUMMARY.md):

**Morning (Research - 4 hours)**:
- Rigorous proof of Theorem D.1 Part 1 (Fisher = Fubini-Study)
- Computational verification (run fisher_metric_N3.py)

**Afternoon (Paper - 2 hours)**:
- Draft Section 7 limitations paragraph
- Begin permutohedron visualization sketch

**Total**: ~6 hours

---

## Session Protocol Established

**Session_Log/ folder** is now the continuing protocol for session documentation:
- Each session creates log entry
- Main status tracked in SESSION_STATUS.md
- Accomplishments documented in SESSION_ACCOMPLISHMENTS_*.md
- This file: SESSION_2025_10_05_CONTINUATION.md

**CHANGELOG.md archived** - Session_Log protocol replaces it
