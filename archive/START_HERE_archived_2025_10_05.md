# START HERE - Session Resume Guide

**Last Updated**: October 5, 2025
**Status**: Week 1 Complete, Week 2 Ready to Begin

## üéØ What We're Doing (60-Second Summary)

**Decision**: Pursue **completeness over publication** - actually solve the gaps rather than just moderate claims.

**Two gaps identified by peer reviewer**:
1. ‚ùå Quantum Dynamics (no Schr√∂dinger equation - only static Born probabilities)
2. ‚ùå Lorentz Invariance (no relativity - discrete structure, not continuous)

**Strategy**: Simultaneous work
- 70% time: Dynamics research (derive Schr√∂dinger equation from Fisher metric)
- 30% time: Paper revision (add axioms section, moderate claims)

**Week 1 Result**: ‚úÖ Strong progress both tracks

2. ‚úÖ Addressed 3/5 reviewer concerns (logic‚Üípermutation, reference order, circularity)
3. ‚úÖ Philosophical clarity achieved (axioms vs. derivations)

## üéØ Week 2 Tasks (Next Steps)

### Monday-Tuesday (Dynamics)

### Saturday (Paper)
- [ ] Create permutohedron visualization (N=3 hexagon)

### Sunday (Integration)
- [ ] Assess progress, plan Week 3

**Estimated time**: 25-30 hours

## üí° Key Breakthroughs

### Graph Laplacian is NOT Ad Hoc

**Discovery**: The Hamiltonian H = D - A emerges NATURALLY from:
1. Fisher information metric on probability spaces
2. Fubini-Study metric on quantum states (equivalent)
3. Laplace-Beltrami operator on Riemannian manifold
4. For discrete manifold (permutohedron) ‚Üí graph Laplacian

**Impact**: Resolves reviewer's "speculative Hamiltonian" concern completely.

**Next**: Formalize this connection rigorously (Theorem D.1)

---

### Axioms Clarify Foundations

**Section 2.2.0 states explicitly**:
- **Axiom 1**: Classical logic governs measurement outcomes (empirically supported)
- **Axiom 2**: Identity permutation is reference state (3 justifications)
- **Then derive**: Permutation representation canonical, inversion count unique, K=N-2 proven

**Impact**: Transforms "ad hoc mapping" criticism into rigorous axiomatization.

**Comparison**:
- Standard QM: 5 axioms
- LFT: 2 axioms ‚Üí derives 3 QM axioms (fewer postulates!)

## üöÄ How to Continue

### Option A: Dynamics Research (Recommended if focused)
1. Read `DYNAMICS_LITERATURE_NOTES.md`
2. Download/read Reginatto (1998) paper
3. Begin formalization (Fubini-Study ‚Üí graph Laplacian)

### Option B: Paper Revision (Recommended if want quick win)
1. Read `Section_2.2.0_FOUNDATIONAL_AXIOMS.md`
2. Begin moderating claims (Abstract, Section 1.1)
3. Create permutohedron figure

### Option C: Both (Recommended - what we're doing)
1. 70% dynamics, 30% paper
2. Follow Week 2 plan above
3. Assess Friday, adjust if needed
