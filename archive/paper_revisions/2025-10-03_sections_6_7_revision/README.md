# Paper Revision Archive: Sections 6-7 (2025-10-03)

**Date**: October 3, 2025
**Revision Focus**: Sections 6 (Experimental Predictions) and 7 (Formal Verification)
**Commit**: `56d707d` - Major revision with honest verification status and multi-LLM methodology

## Overview

This archive contains the working files from a major revision of the scholarly paper that addressed three critical issues:

1. **False verification claims** → Honest ~35% coverage assessment
2. **Missing multi-LLM innovation** → Added comprehensive 7.2 subsection
3. **Overconfident predictions** → Generalized to testable qualitative patterns

## Key Changes Implemented

### Section 6: Experimental Predictions
**Before**: Specific numerical predictions (circuit depth = 4.5-6.0, CHSH = 1.225, etc.)
**After**: Qualitative patterns, scaling relationships, falsifiability criteria

**Major Additions**:
- Universal Constraint Accumulation Function C(ε) with derivation from 3FLL
- Falsification tests (if c₃ ≥ 0, LFT falsified)
- Distinguishing experiments (LFT vs standard QM)
- Comprehensive experimental validation strategy

### Section 7: Formal Verification
**Before**: Claims of "complete verification" with fabricated Lean code
**After**: Honest ~35% coverage with real repository code

**Major Additions**:
- 7.2 Multi-LLM AI-Assisted Formal Verification Methodology (NEW - 2,000+ words)
  - Two-tier architecture (Claude Code + Grok/GPT-4/Gemini)
  - Real-world example (MVT theorem problem)
  - Lean 3/4 validation system
  - Open source implementation details
- Real Lean 4 code from `FeasibilityRatio.lean` and `PermutationGeometry.lean`
- Open science infrastructure and contribution guidelines
- Current limitations and development roadmap

### Section 3: Foundations
**Added**: Empirical Justification for Three Fundamental Laws
- Logic as prescriptive for reality (not descriptive for reasoning)
- Comparison with alternative logical systems
- Connection to observed Bell inequality violations

## Impact

**Scientific Integrity**: Repository now matches paper claims
**Methodological Innovation**: Multi-LLM consultation highlighted as major contribution
**Testability**: Clear falsification criteria and distinguishing experiments
**Reproducibility**: Complete open science infrastructure documented

## Statistics

- **Lines changed**: +521 insertions, -257 deletions
- **Net addition**: +264 lines (1,110 → 1,374 total)
- **Word count increase**: ~4,000 words added (primarily Section 7.2)
