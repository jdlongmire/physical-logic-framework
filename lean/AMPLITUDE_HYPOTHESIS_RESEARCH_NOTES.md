# Amplitude Hypothesis Research Notes

**Date Started**: 2025-01-04
**Status**: Active research (Priority 1)
**Goal**: Prove or disprove that |a_œÉ|¬≤ ‚àù indicator(h(œÉ) ‚â§ K(N))

---

## The Problem

### **Unproven Conjecture**

```
|a_œÉ|¬≤ ‚àù indicator(h(œÉ) ‚â§ K(N))
```

Where:
- œÉ ‚àà S‚Çô (permutation)
- h(œÉ) = inversion count
- K(N) = constraint threshold (K(3)=1, K(4)=2)
- a_œÉ = quantum amplitude

**Current Status**: Ad-hoc assumption, not derived from first principles

**Impact**: Without this, LFT cannot claim to derive the Born rule

---

## Literature Review Findings

### **1. Harmonic Analysis on Symmetric Groups**

**Key Finding**: Historical connection between group representations and quantum mechanics

**Sources**:
- "Quantum Statistical Mechanics and Lie Group Harmonic Analysis" (Hurt & Hermann)
- "Group Theory in Quantum Mechanics" (various)
- **Historical**: Wigner, von Neumann, Stone worked on representation theory for quantum foundations

**Relevant Concepts**:
- Irreducible representations of S‚Çô labeled by Young diagrams
- Characters œá_Œª(œÉ) for partition Œª
- Fourier analysis on finite groups
- Plancherel theorem for S‚Çô

**Inversion Count Connection**:
- Inversions directly related to **sign representation**: sgn(œÉ) = (-1)^h(œÉ)
- **Mahonian numbers** count permutations by inversion count
- Connection to q-analogues and q-factorials

**Open Question**: Can we express indicator function I(h(œÉ) ‚â§ K) as sum of irreducible characters?
```
I(h(œÉ) ‚â§ K) = Œ£_Œª c_Œª œá_Œª(œÉ)
```

**Assessment**:
- ‚úÖ Promising: Direct connection exists (sign representation)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenge: Only one-dimensional sign rep explicitly uses inversions
- üìö Next: Study Diaconis "Group Representations in Probability and Statistics" (1988)

### **2. Maximum Entropy & Entropic Dynamics**

**Key Finding**: Ariel Caticha has derived quantum mechanics from entropy principles!

**Caticha's Entropic Dynamics (ED)**:
- Derives QM from entropic inference methods
- **Wave function is epistemic**: |œà|¬≤ is probability distribution
- Phase controls probability flow
- **Claims to derive Born rule** from information-theoretic principles

**Key Papers**:
1. Caticha, "Entropic Dynamics: Quantum Mechanics from Entropy and Information Geometry" (2019)
   - Annalen der Physik, doi: 10.1002/andp.201700408
2. Caticha, "The Entropic Dynamics Approach to Quantum Mechanics" (MDPI Entropy, 2019)
   - doi: 10.3390/e21100943
3. Caticha, "Insufficient Reason and Entropy in Quantum Theory" (Found. Phys., 2000)
   - Springer, doi: 10.1023/A:1003692916756

**Caticha's Approach**:
- **Principle of maximum entropy** under constraints
- **Consistent amplitude approach**: uniform weighting when no preference
- **Born rule derivation**: Probabilities emerge from entropy maximization
- Quote: "The problem of deriving the Born rule from a fundamental Hilbert space structure does not arise and the burden of explanation runs in the opposite direction"

**Relevance to LFT**:
- ‚úÖ **Directly relevant**: We also use entropy/information principles!
- ‚úÖ Shows Born rule CAN be derived from entropy
- ‚ùì Question: Can we adapt Caticha's approach to constraint-based filtering?

**Assessment**:
- ‚úÖ **Highly promising**: Proven path from entropy ‚Üí Born rule exists
- üéØ **Action**: Study Caticha's papers in detail
- üí° **Hypothesis**: Our constraint satisfaction IS an entropy principle

---

### **3. Other Born Rule Derivations**

**Multiple approaches exist** (from web search):

1. **Zurek (2005)**: Envariance (invariance due to entanglement)
2. **Masanes et al. (2019)**: From basic QM postulates + unique outcomes
   - Featured in Quanta Magazine: "Mysterious Quantum Rule Reconstructed From Scratch"
3. **Saunders**: From operational assumptions

**Consensus**: "No generally accepted derivation of the Born rule"

**Relevant insight from Sean Carroll**:
- Blog post: "Why Probability in Quantum Mechanics is Given by the Wave Function Squared"
- Discussion of various derivation attempts

**Medium article**: "Where Probability Begins: How Entropy Explains the Born Rule"
- By Bill Giannakopoulos
- Explicitly connects entropy to Born rule

**Assessment**:
- ‚úÖ Active research area
- ‚úÖ Multiple viable approaches
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No consensus = opportunity for contribution

---

### **4. Representation Theory Details**

**Character Theory Basics** (from search results):

- S‚Çô has conjugacy classes labeled by cycle types (partitions)
- Number of irreducible representations = number of partitions of n
- Murnaghan‚ÄìNakayama rule for computing œá_œÅ(œÄ)
- Hook length formula for dimensions

**Connection to Inversions**:
- Sign character: œá_sign(œÉ) = (-1)^h(œÉ) (direct connection!)
- General characters: No explicit inversion formulas found yet

**Key Resources**:
- "Representation Theory of the Symmetric Group" (MIT PRIMES materials)
- "Representations of the Symmetric Group" (Daphne Kao, U Chicago)
- Wikipedia: "Representation theory of the symmetric group"

**Open Questions**:
1. Can constraint indicator be decomposed into irreps?
2. Do other characters have inversion interpretations?
3. Is there a "constraint representation" of S‚Çô?

## Research Directions (Prioritized)

### **Direction A: Entropic Dynamics Adaptation** üî¥ HIGHEST PRIORITY

**Hypothesis**: Constraint satisfaction IS a maximum entropy principle

**Strategy**:
1. Study Caticha's ED framework in detail
2. Identify his "consistent amplitude" assumption
3. Map our constraint filtering to his entropy maximization
4. Prove: MaxEnt with constraint h(œÉ) ‚â§ K gives uniform on valid states

**Probability of Success**: 50-60% (high because Caticha shows it works!)

**Timeline**: 2-4 months

**Next Actions**:

- Our constraint filtering is information-theoretic
- K(N) ‚âà N(N-1)/4 is an entropy threshold (MaxInformationEntropy)
- Uniform distribution on valid states maximizes entropy

---

### **Direction B: Harmonic Analysis on S‚Çô** üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Hypothesis**: Constraint indicator decomposes into irreducible characters

**Strategy**:
1. Study Diaconis (1988) - freely available on Project Euclid
2. Compute Fourier expansion of I(h(œÉ) ‚â§ K) on S‚ÇÉ and S‚ÇÑ

2. ‚è≥ Review character tables for S‚ÇÉ and S‚ÇÑ
3. ‚è≥ Compute Fourier coefficients for N=3 case
4. ‚è≥ Look for patterns

**Challenge**:
- Sign character is only known inversion-based character
- May not generalize to constraint threshold

---

### **Direction C: Variational Principle** üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Probability of Success**: 25-35%

**Timeline**: 4-8 months

**Resources**:
- Amari, "Information Geometry and Its Applications" (2016)
- Quantum Fisher information literature

---

### **Direction D: Statistical Mechanics** üü¢ LOWER PRIORITY

**Hypothesis**: Constraint violation acts as energy, Œ≤ ‚Üí ‚àû limit gives sharp cutoff

**Strategy**:
1. Define E_œÉ = max(0, h(œÉ) - K(N))
2. Partition function Z = Œ£ exp(-Œ≤E_œÉ)
3. Take Œ≤ ‚Üí ‚àû limit
4. Recover indicator function

**Probability of Success**: 20-30%

**Challenge**:
- Need physical justification for "temperature"
