# Logic Field Theory: Feasibility Ratio with Mathlib Enhancement

This file establishes the foundational mathematical properties of the feasibility ratio ρ_N
in Logic Field Theory (LFT), enhanced with mathlib while maintaining compatibility.

## Main definitions

* `ValidArrangements N` : Number of valid arrangements satisfying constraints  
* `TotalArrangements N` : Total possible arrangements (N!)
* Core bounds and properties leveraging mathlib where possible

## Main results

* `arrangements_bounds` : Enhanced bounds using mathlib arithmetic
* `lft_constraint_based_integration` : Demonstrates successful constraint-based derivation
* Specific validated values for N=3 and N=4 from computational notebooks

## References

Based on validated computational results from LFT notebooks 00-05.

/-- COMPUTATIONAL VALIDATION: All permutations have finite inversion count

    PROOF STATUS: Partial (cardinality formula accepted as axiom)

    MATHEMATICAL JUSTIFICATION:
    - Inversion count ≤ |{(i,j) : i < j in Fin N}|
    - This set has cardinality choose(N,2) = N*(N-1)/2 (standard combinatorics)
    - The subset relation is proven below
    - Transitivity completes the bound

    The combinatorial formula |{(i,j) : i < j}| = N*(N-1)/2 is mathematically obvious:
    - Total pairs: N²
    - Diagonal (i=i): N
    - Off-diagonal symmetric pairs: (N² - N)/2 for each half
    - Formula: (N² - N)/2 = N*(N-1)/2

    MATHLIB THEOREM (location uncertain): Fintype.card_powersetCard relates
    k-element subsets to choose(n,k), but direct application for ordered pairs
    with i < j constraint requires careful type matching.

    This theorem is NOT used by other proofs - it establishes a general bound.

- Our 6 permutations are provably distinct (decidable equality)
- Exhaustive finite enumeration is technically possible but non-trivial in Lean 4
- Computational verification in notebooks confirms completeness

a result independently verified computationally in notebooks 03-05.
