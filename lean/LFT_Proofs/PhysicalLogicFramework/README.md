# Physical Logic Framework - Lean 4 Formal Proofs

**Logic Field Theory (LFT) Mathematical Foundations**

## Overview

This module contains the formal mathematical verification of Logic Field Theory using Lean 4. The framework derives quantum mechanics from logical consistency requirements, demonstrating that physical reality emerges from the logic field operator **L** acting on information space **I**: **A = L(I)**.

## Core Thesis

**A = L(I)** - Physical actuality emerges from a logic field operator L (Identity ∩ Non-Contradiction ∩ Excluded Middle) filtering information probability space I.
