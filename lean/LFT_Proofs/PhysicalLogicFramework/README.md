# Physical Logic Framework - Lean 4 Formal Proofs

**Logic Field Theory (LFT) Mathematical Foundations**

## Overview

This module contains the formal mathematical verification of Logic Field Theory using Lean 4. LFT proposes that quantum mechanics emerges necessarily from logical consistency requirements, establishing that **reality has no choice but to be quantum** to avoid violating the three fundamental laws of logic.

## Core Thesis

**A = L(I)** - Physical actuality emerges from a logic field operator L enforcing logical constraints on infinite information probability space I.

### ðŸš§ Planned Extensions (Supporting LFT_Paper_5)

These modules will provide complete formal verification of all major theorems from LFT_Paper_5:

**Priority 1 - Mathematical Foundations**
- Theorem 2.1: Logic Forces Probability - 3FLL determines unique probability structure
- Theorem 2.2: CarathÃ©odory Extension - Probability extension to Ïƒ-algebra  
- Theorem 4.2: Forced Non-distributivity - Bell violations require orthomodular logic

## Key Mathematical Results

### Constraint Theory Validation
| N | Constraint Threshold K(N) | Valid Arrangements | Total | Ratio |
|---|---------------------------|-------------------|-------|-------|
| 3 | 1 | 2 | 6 | 1/3 |
| 4 | 3 | 9 | 24 | 3/8 |

### Information-Theoretic Justification
- Maximum entropy bound: `MaxInformationEntropy N = N*(N-1)/4`
- K(3) = 1 â‰¤ 1.5 (respects entropy limit)
- K(4) = 3 â‰¤ 3.0 (at entropy boundary)

### Geometric Properties
- Sâ‚ƒ permutohedron: 2D structure, 6 vertices â†’ 2 constraint-valid
- Sâ‚„ permutohedron: 3D structure, 24 vertices â†’ 9 constraint-valid  
- Spatial dimensions: N-1 (critical for N=4 â†’ 3+1 spacetime)

### Quantum Connections
- State space: Constraint-filtered permutation configurations
- Born probabilities: Uniform over valid arrangements (1/ValidArrangements)
- Measurement: Projection onto constraint-valid subspace
- Bell violations: Correspond to constraint threshold violations
