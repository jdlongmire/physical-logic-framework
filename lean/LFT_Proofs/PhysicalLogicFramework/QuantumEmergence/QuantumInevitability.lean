# Quantum Mechanics Inevitability

This file establishes the central theorem of Logic Field Theory:

**Bell violations + Logical consistency → Quantum mechanics is inevitable**

## Core Argument

1. Bell violations are empirically observed (CHSH > 2)
2. Logical consistency is empirically required (L1-L3) 
3. Classical Boolean logic cannot accommodate both
4. Therefore: Non-Boolean (quantum) logic is forced
5. Quantum logic uniquely determines quantum mechanics

## Main theorem

* `quantum_mechanics_inevitable` : The combination of empirical observations
  and logical requirements uniquely forces quantum mechanical structure

## Physical Interpretation

This proves that **reality has no choice but to be quantum** because
classical logical structures are incompatible with observed phenomena
when logical consistency is maintained.

**BOOLEAN-BELL INCOMPATIBILITY THEOREM**

Boolean logical structures cannot produce Bell violations when logical
consistency is maintained. This is the content of Bell's theorem:
classical local realism (Boolean logic) implies Bell inequalities.

**THE CLASSICAL CRISIS**

We have three mutually incompatible claims:
1. Classical logic assumption (Boolean structure)
2. Bell violations observed (empirical fact)
3. Logical consistency required (empirical fact)

Since we cannot abandon the empirical facts, we must abandon classical logic.

Quantum logic is the unique non-Boolean logical structure that can

This structure is characterized by orthomodular lattices.

**FALSIFICATION CRITERION**

LFT can be falsified by finding a logical structure that:
1. Is not quantum logic (not orthomodular)
2. Accommodates Bell violations  
3. Preserves logical consistency

Such a discovery would require new physics beyond quantum mechanics.

**LFT FOUNDATIONAL SUMMARY**

This module establishes the logical inevitability of quantum mechanics:

1. **Empirical Constraints**: Bell violations and logical consistency observed
2. **Classical Impossibility**: Boolean logic cannot satisfy both constraints  
3. **Quantum Necessity**: Non-Boolean (quantum) logic is the unique solution
4. **Structural Consequences**: Quantum logic → Hilbert spaces → Born rule
5. **Falsifiable Theory**: Specific experimental predictions enable testing

**Core Result**: Reality has no choice but to be quantum because any other
logical structure violates either empirical observations or logical consistency.
