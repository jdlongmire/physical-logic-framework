# Born Rule and Gleason's Theorem Formalization

This file completes the Logic Field Theory formal verification by implementing
Gleason's theorem and deriving the Born rule from logical constraints.

## Core Components

1. **Frame Functions**: Probability measures on projection lattices
2. **Density Operators**: Positive trace-1 operators representing quantum states
3. **Gleason's Theorem**: Every frame function = trace formula  
4. **Born Rule**: |⟨ψ|P|ψ⟩|² probability rule for pure states
5. **Complete Emergence**: Logical constraints → Born rule → Quantum mechanics

## Main Result

Constraint accumulation + Orthomodular logic → Gleason's theorem → Born rule → QM

This completes the formal proof: **Reality has no choice but to be quantum**
