# Quantum Mechanics Inevitability - Simplified Version

This file establishes the central theorem of Logic Field Theory in a simplified form:

**Bell violations + Logical consistency → Quantum mechanics is inevitable**

## Core Argument

1. Classical Boolean logic cannot accommodate Bell violations
2. Bell violations are empirically observed  
3. Logical consistency is empirically required
4. Therefore: Non-Boolean (quantum) logic is forced
5. Quantum logic uniquely determines quantum mechanics

## Main theorem

* `quantum_mechanics_inevitable` : The combination of empirical observations
  and logical requirements uniquely forces quantum mechanical structure

## Physical Interpretation

This proves that **reality has no choice but to be quantum** because
classical logical structures are incompatible with observed phenomena
when logical consistency is maintained.

**BOOLEAN-BELL INCOMPATIBILITY THEOREM**

Boolean logical structures cannot produce Bell violations when logical
consistency is maintained. This is the content of Bell's theorem.

theorem boolean_bell_incompatibility :
  ClassicalLogicAssumption →
  LogicalConsistencyRequired →
  ¬BellViolationsObserved := by
  intro h_classical h_logical h_bell
  -- Boolean logic with logical consistency implies local hidden variables
  -- Local hidden variables satisfy Bell inequalities (CHSH ≤ 2)
  -- This contradicts observed Bell violations (CHSH > 2)
  -- This is the standard result of Bell's theorem

**THE CLASSICAL CRISIS**

We have three mutually incompatible claims:
1. Classical logic assumption (Boolean structure)
2. Bell violations observed (empirical fact)
3. Logical consistency required (empirical fact)

Since we cannot abandon the empirical facts, we must abandon classical logic.

**NON-BOOLEAN LOGIC NECESSITY**

Since Boolean logic is incompatible with empirical facts, and we cannot
abandon the empirical facts, we must adopt non-Boolean logical structure.

Quantum logic is the unique non-Boolean logical structure that can
accommodate Bell violations while preserving logical consistency.

**QUANTUM LOGIC ACCOMMODATION**

Quantum logical structures can accommodate both Bell violations and
logical consistency. This is what makes quantum mechanics possible.

**MAIN THEOREM: QUANTUM MECHANICS IS INEVITABLE**

Given the empirical facts (Bell violations and logical consistency),
quantum mechanics is the unique possible description of physical reality.

This establishes that **reality has no choice but to be quantum**.

**UNIQUENESS OF QUANTUM STRUCTURE**

Quantum logic is not just possible but necessary. It is the unique
logical structure that satisfies empirical constraints.

**HILBERT SPACE NECESSITY**

Quantum logic (orthomodular lattices) leads to Hilbert space structure
via the Piron-Solèr representation theorem.

space lattices must follow the Born rule.

**FALSIFICATION CRITERION**

LFT can be falsified by finding a logical structure that:
1. Is not quantum logic (not orthomodular)
2. Accommodates Bell violations  
3. Preserves logical consistency

Such a discovery would require new physics beyond quantum mechanics.

**LFT FOUNDATIONAL SUMMARY**

This module establishes the logical inevitability of quantum mechanics:

1. **Empirical Constraints**: Bell violations and logical consistency observed
2. **Classical Impossibility**: Boolean logic cannot satisfy both constraints  
3. **Quantum Necessity**: Non-Boolean (quantum) logic is the unique solution
4. **Structural Consequences**: Quantum logic → Hilbert spaces → Born rule
5. **Falsifiable Theory**: Specific experimental predictions enable testing

**Core Result**: Reality has no choice but to be quantum because any other
logical structure violates either empirical observations or logical consistency.
