# Logic Field Theory: Permutation Geometry Building on Feasibility

This file establishes the geometric structure of LFT based on the symmetric group S_N
and its geometric realization as the permutohedron, building on the feasibility ratio
foundations and leveraging mathlib's group theory.

## Main definitions

* Builds on `ValidArrangements N`, `TotalArrangements N` from FeasibilityRatio
* `SymmetricGroup N` : Compatible definition with mathlib
* Advanced geometric and group-theoretic properties

## Main results

* `symmetric_group_feasibility_connection` : Links to feasibility ratio foundations
* `geometric_validation_connection` : Connects geometry to LFT validation
* `geometry_builds_on_feasibility` : Demonstrates proper dependency structure

## References

Based on validated results from LFT notebooks 03-04 and the computational
validation established in FeasibilityRatio.lean.
