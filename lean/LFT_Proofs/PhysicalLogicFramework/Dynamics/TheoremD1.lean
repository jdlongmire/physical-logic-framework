# Theorem D.1: Graph Laplacian as Natural Hamiltonian (Complete Statement)

This module integrates all three parts of Theorem D.1, proving that the graph Laplacian
H = D - A emerges as the unique natural Hamiltonian on discrete permutation state spaces.

## Theorem Statement

**Theorem D.1** (Graph Laplacian as Natural Hamiltonian):

Let:
- V_K ⊂ S_N = valid permutation state space (h(σ) ≤ K)
- Γ = (V_K, E) = Cayley graph (edges = adjacent transpositions)
- ℋ_K = ℂ^{|V_K|} = Hilbert space
- ℙ(ℋ_K) = projective Hilbert space (quantum state manifold)
- g_FS = Fubini-Study metric on ℙ(ℋ_K)
- L = D - A = graph Laplacian on Γ

Then the following three statements hold:

### Part 1: Fisher-Fubini-Study Equivalence
For pure quantum states ρ(σ) = |ψ(σ)|², the Fisher information metric equals
the Fubini-Study metric:
```
g_F = 4 g_FS
```

### Part 2: Discrete Laplace-Beltrami
The Laplace-Beltrami operator Δ_g on (ℙ(ℋ_K), g_FS) discretizes to the graph Laplacian:
```
Δ_g f ≈ (Lf)(v) = Σ_{u~v} [f(v) - f(u)]
```

### Part 3: Variational Principle
States minimizing Fisher information I_F[ψ] = ⟨ψ|L|ψ⟩ satisfy:
```
L ψ = λ ψ  (eigenvalue equation)
i ∂ψ/∂t = L ψ  (Schrödinger equation)
```

### Combined Result
Therefore, the graph Laplacian H = L = D - A is the unique natural Hamiltonian,
being simultaneously:
1. The geometric operator from quantum (Fubini-Study) metric
2. The discrete differential operator (Laplace-Beltrami) on state manifold
3. The variational operator minimizing Fisher information

**This is NOT an arbitrary choice but a mathematical necessity.**
