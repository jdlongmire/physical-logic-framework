# Graph Laplacian as Natural Hamiltonian (Theorem D.1 - Part Infrastructure)

This module establishes the graph Laplacian L = D - A as the natural Hamiltonian
operator for quantum dynamics on discrete permutation state spaces (permutohedron).

## Main definitions

* `PermutohedronGraph N`: The Cayley graph of S_N with adjacent transpositions as edges
* `Hamiltonian N`: The graph Laplacian H = D - A for the permutohedron
* `validStates N K`: The K-constrained valid state space V_K ⊂ S_N

## Main theorems (Sprint 1)

* `hamiltonian_symmetric`: H is symmetric (H = H†)
* `hamiltonian_posSemidef`: H is positive semidefinite
* `hamiltonian_has_zero_eigenvalue`: Constant vector is eigenvector with eigenvalue 0
* `hamiltonian_quadratic_form`: ⟨ψ|H|ψ⟩ = Fisher information

## Connection to Theorem D.1

This module provides the foundational structure for Theorem D.1, which proves that
the graph Laplacian emerges as the unique natural Hamiltonian from three independent
mathematical principles:

1. Information geometry (Fisher = Fubini-Study)
2. Discrete Riemannian geometry (Laplace-Beltrami → Graph Laplacian)
3. Variational principle (minimum Fisher information)

See `TheoremD1.lean` for the complete integrated theorem.

## Permutohedron Graph Structure

The permutohedron is a convex polytope whose vertices are permutations of {1,...,N}
and edges connect permutations differing by a single adjacent transposition.
It forms the Cayley graph of the symmetric group S_N with generating set
of adjacent transpositions.
-/

/-- A permutation σ is valid if h(σ) ≤ K, where h counts inversions.
For now, we include all permutations (K = ∞), but this will be refined
to match the constraint theory (K = N-2 for maximal quantum behavior). -/
def validPerm (N K : ℕ) (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin N)) : Prop :=
  true  -- TODO: Add inversion count h(σ) ≤ K constraint

/-- Two permutations are adjacent if they differ by swapping adjacent elements.
This defines the edge relation for the permutohedron Cayley graph. -/
def adjacentTransposition {N : ℕ} (σ τ : Equiv.Perm (Fin N)) : Prop :=
  ∃ i : Fin (N - 1), τ = σ * Equiv.swap ⟨i, Nat.lt_of_lt_of_le i.2 (Nat.sub_le N 1)⟩
    ⟨i + 1, by omega⟩

/-- Adjacent transpositions are loopless: σ * swap(i, i+1) ≠ σ for any permutation σ.
This follows from the fact that swap(i, i+1) is a non-trivial permutation.
**Mathematical justification**: If σ = σ * s for some permutation s, then s = 1 (identity).
But swap(i, i+1) ≠ 1 for i ≠ i+1, so σ * swap(i, i+1) ≠ σ.
**Reference**: Standard result in group theory (non-trivial group elements act non-trivially). -/

/-- The permutohedron graph: vertices are permutations, edges are adjacent transpositions.
This is the Cayley graph Cay(S_N, T) where T is the set of adjacent transpositions. -/

## Hamiltonian Operator (Graph Laplacian)

The Hamiltonian H is defined as the graph Laplacian L = D - A where:
- D is the degree matrix (diagonal)
- A is the adjacency matrix (0/1 entries for edges)

This definition uses Mathlib's `SimpleGraph.lapMatrix` which provides
all basic properties automatically.

## Basic Properties (from Mathlib)

These theorems import fundamental properties of the graph Laplacian
directly from Mathlib's `SimpleGraph.LapMatrix` module.

## Quadratic Form and Fisher Information

The quadratic form ⟨ψ|H|ψ⟩ equals the Fisher information functional I_F[ψ].
This connection is central to Theorem D.1 Part 3 (minimum Fisher info → Hamiltonian).
-/

/-- The Hamiltonian quadratic form ⟨ψ|H|ψ⟩ equals a sum over edges.
This is the discrete analog of the Fisher information metric. -/

## Cayley Graph Properties

The permutohedron is a regular graph (all vertices have the same degree N-1)
and is vertex-transitive (symmetric group acts transitively). The regularity
follows from standard Cayley graph theory: each vertex has exactly N-1 adjacent
transpositions.

## Connection to Theorem D.1

This module provides Part 0 (infrastructure) for Theorem D.1:

**Theorem D.1** (Graph Laplacian as Natural Hamiltonian):
The graph Laplacian H = D - A emerges as the unique natural Hamiltonian on
discrete permutation state spaces from three independent principles:

* **Part 1** (FisherGeometry.lean): Fisher metric = Fubini-Study metric
* **Part 2** (ConvergenceTheorem.lean): Laplace-Beltrami → Graph Laplacian
* **Part 3** (VariationalPrinciple.lean): Min Fisher info → H = L

See `TheoremD1.lean` for the complete integration.
