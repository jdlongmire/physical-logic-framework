# Convergence: Laplace-Beltrami to Graph Laplacian (Theorem D.1 Part 2)

This module formalizes the convergence theorem showing that the graph Laplacian
is the natural discrete approximation of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a
Riemannian manifold.

## Main definitions

* `LaplaceBeltrami`: The Laplace-Beltrami operator on a Riemannian manifold (axiomatized)
* `DiscreteApproximation`: Graph approximation of a manifold

## Main theorem (Part 2 of Theorem D.1)

* `laplace_beltrami_to_graph_laplacian`: Laplace-Beltrami converges to Graph Laplacian

## References

* Belkin & Niyogi (2008): "Towards a theoretical foundation for Laplacian-based
  manifold methods", NIPS
* Chung (1997): "Spectral Graph Theory", AMS

## Implementation Strategy

The Laplace-Beltrami operator and convergence theorem are axiomatized as:
1. Mathlib lacks full Riemannian manifold Laplacian support
2. Belkin & Niyogi's convergence is a deep result requiring extensive analysis
3. Both are standard, rigorously proven in the literature

Sprint 3 focuses on stating these axioms with clear citations.

## Riemannian Manifold and Laplace-Beltrami Operator

The Laplace-Beltrami operator is the natural generalization of the Laplacian
to Riemannian manifolds. On a manifold (M, g) with metric g, it is defined as:

Δ_g f = (1/√det(g)) ∂_i(√det(g) g^ij ∂_j f)

We axiomatize this as Mathlib's manifold support is still developing.

## Discrete Approximation and Convergence

The key insight is that when we sample a Riemannian manifold at discrete points
and form a graph, the graph Laplacian approximates the Laplace-Beltrami operator.

This is the Belkin & Niyogi (2008) convergence theorem:
For a manifold M with metric g, sampled at points V with neighborhood size ε,
the normalized graph Laplacian L_ε converges to the Laplace-Beltrami operator
as ε -> 0 and |V| -> ∞.

## Theorem D.1 Part 2: Laplace-Beltrami Converges to Graph Laplacian

**Theorem D.1.2** (Belkin & Niyogi Convergence):
For a graph G approximating a Riemannian manifold M, the graph Laplacian
converges to the Laplace-Beltrami operator in the limit ε -> 0, n -> ∞.

**Reference**: Belkin & Niyogi (2008), "Towards a theoretical foundation for
Laplacian-based manifold methods", NIPS

**Proof Strategy** (axiomatized):
1. Sample manifold M at points V with density depending on ε
2. Construct graph with edges for points within distance ε
3. Define normalized graph Laplacian L_ε
4. Show pointwise convergence: (L_ε f)(v) -> (Δ_g f)(v) as ε -> 0

This is a deep result requiring:
- Manifold approximation theory
- Heat kernel analysis
- Convergence in appropriate function spaces

We axiomatize it with clear citation to the rigorous literature proof.
-/

/-- **Theorem D.1 Part 2**: Laplace-Beltrami operator converges to Graph Laplacian.

For a Riemannian manifold approximated by a graph, the graph Laplacian is the
natural discrete approximation of the Laplace-Beltrami operator.

**Citation**: Belkin & Niyogi (2008), NIPS
**Status**: Axiomatized (Sprint 3) - requires extensive manifold analysis to prove

The convergence is in the sense:
  lim_{ε->0, n->∞} ‖L_ε f - Δ_g f‖ = 0
where L_ε is the normalized graph Laplacian and Δ_g is Laplace-Beltrami.

## Application to Permutohedron

For the permutohedron graph with the Fubini-Study metric:
1. The permutohedron is a discrete approximation of projective Hilbert space
2. The Fubini-Study metric induces a Riemannian structure
3. The graph Laplacian H = D - A approximates the Laplace-Beltrami operator

This connection establishes that H is not arbitrary but the natural discrete
differential operator on the quantum state manifold.

## Connection to Theorem D.1

This module provides Part 2 of Theorem D.1:

**Theorem D.1** (Graph Laplacian as Natural Hamiltonian):
The graph Laplacian H = D - A emerges as the unique natural Hamiltonian from:

* **Part 1** (FisherGeometry.lean): Fisher metric = Fubini-Study metric
* **Part 2** (This module): Laplace-Beltrami → Graph Laplacian (Belkin & Niyogi)
* **Part 3** (VariationalPrinciple.lean): Min Fisher info → H = L

See `TheoremD1.lean` for the complete integrated theorem.

## Sprint 3 Completion

**Objectives**:
1. Laplace-Beltrami operator - Axiomatized with clear mathematical definition
2. Convergence theorem - Axiomatized with Belkin & Niyogi citation
3. Part 2 theorem stated - Axiomatized with convergence bounds

**Decision**: Axiomatize rather than prove
- Full proof requires extensive manifold theory beyond Mathlib
- Belkin & Niyogi (2008) provides rigorous published proof
- Can be proven if Mathlib's Riemannian geometry develops

**Status**: Sprint 3 complete (axiomatization with literature support)
