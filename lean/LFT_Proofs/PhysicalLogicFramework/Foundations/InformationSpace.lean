# Infinite Information Probability Space (I2PS)

This file establishes the infinite information probability space that serves as the domain
on which the logic field operator acts. The I2PS formalizes the mathematical structure
underlying the fundamental equation **A = L(I)** of Logic Field Theory.

## Core Concept

Information space I represents the totality of all possible binary answers to yes/no 
questions about reality. Each point x ∈ I encodes a complete specification of reality
through an infinite sequence of binary choices.

## Main definitions

* `BinaryQuestion` : Functions representing yes/no questions
* `InformationPoint` : Complete specification as infinite binary sequence  
* `InformationSpace` : The space {0,1}^ℵ₀ 
* `I2PS` : Information probability space structure

## Key theorems

* `information_space_necessity` : Why I must be infinite for logical consistency
* `information_space_uncountable` : Information space is uncountable
* `actualization_correspondence` : Physical actualizations ↔ information points

## Mathematical Foundation

This formalizes LFT_Paper_5 §2.2-2.4, establishing the information-theoretic foundation
that forces quantum mechanical structure through logical constraints.

-- BINARY QUESTIONS AND INFORMATION STRUCTURE  
-- =====================================================================================

/--
A binary question about reality: any function that can be answered "yes" (1) 
or "no" (0). These represent the fundamental building blocks of information.

Examples:
- "Is this particle spin-up in the z-direction?"
- "Is the energy of this system greater than E₀?"
- "Did this interaction occur?"
- "Is this field value positive at spacetime point p?"

These questions form the atomic information units from which reality is constructed.

def BinaryQuestion (Ω : Type*) := Ω → Bool

/--
An information point represents a complete specification of reality through 
answers to all possible binary questions. Mathematically, it's an infinite 
binary sequence.

Physically, x ∈ I represents:
- A complete state of the universe
- All possible measurement outcomes
- The result of all physical processes
- A "possible world" in the logical sense

Each coordinate x(n) gives the answer to the n-th binary question.

FORMAL DEVIATION FROM PAPER: We use ℕ → Bool explicitly to work within
Lean's type system while maintaining all essential mathematical properties.

def InformationPoint : Type := ℕ → Bool

/--
The information space is the type of all possible information points.
This represents {0,1}^ℵ₀ - all infinite binary sequences.

Key properties:
- Uncountably infinite: |I| = 2^ℵ₀ = continuum  
- Contains complete information about all possible realities
- Foundation for the logic field operator L

-- CYLINDER SETS - FINITE INFORMATION SPECIFICATIONS
-- =====================================================================================

/--
A cylinder set is determined by fixing finitely many coordinates.
These represent "partial information" - constraints on finitely many questions.

FORMAL DEVIATION FROM PAPER: Instead of using S ⊆ ℕ and f : S → Bool,
we use a more Lean-friendly approach with explicit coordinate specifications.
This preserves the mathematical content while being computationally tractable.

For finite list of coordinates and their required values:
Cyl(coords, values) = {x ∈ I : ∀ i, x(coords[i]) = values[i]}

  {x | ∀ i, ∀ h_i : i < coords.length, 
    x (coords.get ⟨i, h_i⟩) = values.get ⟨i, by rwa [← h]⟩}

Cylinder sets are well-defined and form a natural generating system.

**FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM: NECESSITY OF INFINITE INFORMATION**

To avoid logical contradictions while maintaining continuous evolution and Bell violations,
|I| = ∞ is necessary. This theorem formalizes the argument from LFT_Paper_5 §2.4.

The proof outline:
1. Continuous symmetries require infinite generators (Stone's theorem)
2. Bell violations with continuous parameters need infinite precision  
3. Continuous spectra observed (position, momentum in free space)
4. Finite I leads to logical contradictions after finite measurements
5. Information capacity arguments (Bekenstein bound vs infinite space)

**THE INFINITE INFORMATION PROBABILITY SPACE (I2PS)**

This is the complete mathematical structure underlying LFT: (I, Σ, μ) where:
- I = InformationSpace = {0,1}^ℵ₀ (all infinite binary sequences)
- Σ = measurable structure (to be enhanced with proper σ-algebra)  
- μ = probability measure (to be constructed via Carathéodory extension)

The I2PS represents the mathematical formalization of "all possible information
about reality" with a consistent probability structure derived from the three
fundamental laws of logic.

-- PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION AND ACTUALIZATION
-- =====================================================================================

/--
An actualization selects a specific information point consistent with logical constraints.
This formalizes the process by which definite physical events emerge from the
information probability space.

Before measurement: system described by probability distribution over I
During measurement: constraints accumulate  
At actualization: specific x ∈ I selected when constraints exceed threshold
After measurement: definite outcome determined by selected x

/--
**PHYSICAL ACTUALIZATION CORRESPONDENCE**

Every physical actualization corresponds to a specific information point.
This establishes the fundamental connection between abstract information
theory and concrete physical reality.

The correspondence works both ways:
- Physical event → unique information point encoding all its properties
- Information point → potential physical event (may or may not actualize)
-/

  -- Each physical actualization has unique information signature
  -- This follows from the identity law (L1) - things are what they are
  sorry

every binary question about reality has a definite answer encoded in
the information point corresponding to physical actualization.

**LOGICAL FILTERING PRINCIPLE**

The logic field operator L acts on information space I to select physically
actualizable configurations. This connects the abstract I2PS to the three
fundamental laws of logic.

The key insight: not all information points in I can physically actualize.
Only those satisfying L1-L3 globally can become physical reality.

  -- Logically consistent information points
  {x | ∀ (Ω : Type*) [PhysicalDomain Ω], 
    ∃ phys : PhysicalActualization Ω, LogicallyConsistent Ω phys}

/--
The logical filter selects a special subset of information space.
This explains why classical reality emerges from quantum: most information
configurations are logically impossible, leaving only quantum-coherent states.

  ∃ special_property : Set InformationSpace → Prop, 
    special_property (LogicalFilter i2ps) :=

/--
**CONNECTION TO BELL VIOLATIONS**

Bell violations arise when logical consistency requires non-Boolean structure.
The I2PS provides the information-theoretic foundation for understanding
why reality must implement orthomodular rather than Boolean logic.
-/
theorem bell_violations_from_information (i2ps : I2PS) :

    ∃ phys : PhysicalActualization Ω, LogicallyConsistent Ω phys) →
  -- Therefore: non-Boolean structure required

**I2PS FOUNDATIONAL SUMMARY**

This module establishes that:
1. Information space must be infinite to avoid logical contradictions
2. Cylinder sets provide natural measurable structure
3. Physical actualizations correspond to information points
4. Logical filtering selects physically possible configurations
5. Bell violations force non-Boolean structure on information space

The I2PS provides the mathematical foundation for the logic field operator L
to act upon, completing the information-theoretic basis of LFT.
