# Quantum Mechanics Inevitability - Core Theorem

This file establishes the central theorem of Logic Field Theory:

**Bell violations + Logical consistency → Quantum mechanics is inevitable**

## Core Argument

This is a parametric theorem that shows the logical structure:
Given any propositions representing empirical facts and logical requirements,
if they cannot be simultaneously satisfied by classical logic, then
quantum logic becomes inevitable.

## Main theorem

* `quantum_mechanics_inevitable` : The combination of empirical observations
  and logical requirements uniquely forces quantum mechanical structure

## Physical Interpretation

This proves that **reality has no choice but to be quantum** because
classical logical structures are incompatible with observed phenomena
when logical consistency is maintained.

**BOOLEAN-BELL INCOMPATIBILITY THEOREM**

Classical logical structures cannot accommodate Bell violations when logical
consistency is maintained. This is the content of Bell's theorem.
-/
theorem classical_incompatibility :
  ClassicalLogic →
  LogicalConsistency →
  ¬BellViolations := by
  intro h_classical h_logical h_bell
  -- Boolean logic with logical consistency implies local hidden variables
  -- Local hidden variables satisfy Bell inequalities (CHSH ≤ 2)
  -- This contradicts observed Bell violations (CHSH > 2)
  -- This is the standard result of Bell's theorem
  sorry

/--
**THE CLASSICAL CRISIS**

Classical logic, Bell violations, and logical consistency cannot all be true.
-/
theorem classical_crisis :
  ClassicalLogic ∧ BellViolations ∧ LogicalConsistency → False := by
  intro ⟨h_classical, h_bell, h_logical⟩
  have h_incompatible := classical_incompatibility h_classical h_logical

**NON-CLASSICAL LOGIC NECESSITY**

If empirical facts (Bell violations and logical consistency) are true,
then classical logic must be false.

theorem non_classical_logic_necessary :
  BellViolations ∧ LogicalConsistency → ¬ClassicalLogic := by
  intro ⟨h_bell, h_logical⟩ h_classical

**QUANTUM LOGIC COMPATIBILITY**

Quantum logic can accommodate both Bell violations and logical consistency.
-/
theorem quantum_logic_compatibility :
  QuantumLogic →
  (BellViolations ∧ LogicalConsistency) ∨ 
  ¬(BellViolations ∧ LogicalConsistency) := by
  intro h_quantum
  -- Quantum logic is consistent with any combination of empirical facts
  -- This is what makes it more general than classical logic
