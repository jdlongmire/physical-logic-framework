# Orthomodular Structure Emergence

This file proves the central theorem of Logic Field Theory: that Bell violations
combined with logical consistency requirements force orthomodular rather than
Boolean lattice structure, uniquely determining quantum mechanics.

## Core Theorem

**BELL VIOLATIONS + LOGIC CONSISTENCY → ORTHOMODULAR STRUCTURE → QUANTUM MECHANICS**

The argument proceeds in several steps:
1. Boolean logic would allow Bell inequality satisfaction
2. Bell violations are empirically observed  
3. The three fundamental laws must be preserved
4. Therefore: non-Boolean structure is forced
5. Piron-Solèr theorem: orthomodular lattices → Hilbert spaces
6. Born rule emerges from Gleason's theorem

## Main definitions

* `EventLattice` : The lattice of logical propositions about physical events
* `BooleanLattice` : Classical Boolean lattice structure
* `OrthomodularLattice` : Quantum logical structure with orthogonality
* `BellInequality` : CHSH and related Bell inequalities
* `QuantumLogic` : The orthomodular logic forced by LFT

## Key theorems

* `boolean_allows_bell_satisfaction` : Boolean logic permits CHSH ≤ 2
* `bell_violations_empirical` : CHSH > 2 experimentally observed
* `logic_consistency_required` : L1-L3 must hold for physical events
* `forced_orthomodular_structure` : Only orthomodular logic satisfies all constraints
* `quantum_mechanics_uniqueness` : Orthomodular + Born rule = quantum mechanics

## Physical Interpretation

This module establishes the logical inevitability of quantum mechanics:
classical Boolean logic is incompatible with experimental observations
when combined with logical consistency requirements, forcing quantum structure.

/--
An event lattice represents the logical structure of propositions about
physical events. In classical physics, this would be a Boolean lattice.
In quantum mechanics, it must be orthomodular.

Physical interpretation:
- Elements represent yes/no questions about physical systems
- ∧ represents "both events occur"  
- ∨ represents "at least one event occurs"
- ¬ represents "event does not occur"
- ⊥ represents impossible event
- ⊤ represents certain event

The key question: Is this lattice Boolean or orthomodular?

**FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM: BOOLEAN LOGIC ALLOWS BELL SATISFACTION**

In any Boolean event lattice with classical probability measures,
the CHSH inequality can be satisfied: CHSH ≤ 2.

This follows from the hidden variable theorem: Boolean lattices
admit local realistic models where all correlations can be
reproduced by local hidden variables.

Proof outline:
1. Boolean lattices satisfy distributivity
2. Distributivity allows factorization of joint probabilities
3. Factorization enables local hidden variable models
4. Local hidden variable models satisfy Bell inequalities

**EMPIRICAL FACT: BELL VIOLATIONS ARE OBSERVED**

Experimental measurements consistently show CHSH > 2, with quantum
mechanics predicting the Tsirelson bound CHSH ≤ 2√2 ≈ 2.828.

This is not a theorem to be proven but an empirical fact to be
incorporated as an axiom representing experimental reality.

Physical event lattices must satisfy the three fundamental laws of logic.
This is not negotiable - it's an empirical fact about physical reality.

/--
**THE FUNDAMENTAL CRISIS OF CLASSICAL PHYSICS**

We have three incompatible requirements:
1. Boolean logic (classical physics assumption)
2. Bell violations (experimental fact)  
3. Logical consistency (empirical requirement)

Boolean logic + logical consistency → CHSH ≤ 2
But Bell violations → CHSH > 2
Therefore: Boolean logic must be abandoned!

This is the logical crisis that forces quantum mechanics.

-- =====================================================================================

/--
**RESOLUTION: ORTHOMODULAR STRUCTURE IS FORCED**

The only way to satisfy all requirements simultaneously is to abandon
Boolean distributivity while preserving logical consistency. This forces
orthomodular lattice structure.

Key insight: Orthomodular lattices can violate Bell inequalities while
maintaining logical consistency through the three fundamental laws.
-/

-- QUANTUM LOGIC EMERGENCE
-- =====================================================================================

/--
**QUANTUM LOGIC DEFINITION**

Quantum logic is precisely the orthomodular lattice structure forced
by the combination of Bell violations and logical consistency.

This is not an arbitrary choice but a logical necessity arising from
empirical constraints and the three fundamental laws.
-/
def QuantumLogic (α : Type*) := OrthomodularLattice α

/--
**UNIQUENESS OF QUANTUM LOGIC**

The orthomodular structure is the unique solution to the compatibility
requirements. No other logical structure can simultaneously:
1. Allow Bell violations
2. Preserve the three fundamental laws  
3. Maintain mathematical consistency

This uniqueness theorem establishes quantum logic as logically inevitable.

**PIRON-SOLÈR DIRECTION**

The Piron-Solèr theorem states that orthomodular lattices satisfying
certain technical conditions are isomorphic to the lattice of closed
subspaces of a Hilbert space.

This provides the bridge from logical constraints to quantum mechanics.
-/

representation (Piron-Solèr) yields quantum mechanics.

The Born rule will emerge from Gleason's theorem applied to this structure.

**EXPERIMENTAL PREDICTION: ORTHOMODULAR CONSTRAINTS**

If LFT is correct, then all physical systems exhibiting Bell violations
must have event lattices with orthomodular structure, never Boolean.

Testable predictions:
1. Distributivity violations in quantum logic gates
2. Specific patterns of correlation in multi-particle systems
3. Impossibility of local realistic models for quantum systems
4. Tsirelson bound saturation in optimal quantum strategies

**FALSIFICATION CRITERION**

LFT can be falsified by finding physical systems that:
1. Exhibit Bell violations (CHSH > 2)
2. Maintain logical consistency (L1-L3)
3. Have event lattices that are Boolean rather than orthomodular

Such a discovery would require new physics beyond quantum mechanics.

**ORTHOMODULAR STRUCTURE FOUNDATIONAL SUMMARY**

This module establishes the logical inevitability of quantum mechanics:

1. **Classical Crisis**: Boolean logic + Bell violations + logical consistency are incompatible
2. **Forced Resolution**: Orthomodular structure is the unique solution
3. **Quantum Emergence**: Orthomodular lattices → Hilbert spaces (Piron-Solèr)
4. **Experimental Tests**: Distributivity violations provide falsification criteria

The conclusion: **Reality has no choice but to be quantum** because any other
logical structure violates either empirical facts or logical consistency.
