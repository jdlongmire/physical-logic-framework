# Algebraic Structure for Bosons and Fermions

This module formalizes the operator algebras for bosonic and fermionic systems.

**Sprint 11 Goal**: Derive the distinction between bosons (commutation algebra) and
fermions (anticommutation algebra) from 3FLL + epistemic constraints.

**Key Question**: Can we derive that only **pure** operator algebras (either commutation
OR anticommutation, not mixed) are consistent with well-defined propositions?

**Building on Sprint 10**: Sprint 10 derived that only symmetric OR antisymmetric states
are well-defined for indistinguishable particles. Sprint 11 extends this to show:
- Symmetric states ↔ Commutation algebra (bosons)
- Antisymmetric states ↔ Anticommutation algebra (fermions)

## Background

**Standard QM**: Two distinct operator algebras are postulated without derivation:

**Bosonic operators** (photons, phonons, helium-4, ...):
- Creation: â†ₖ, Annihilation: âₖ
- Commutation relations: [âᵢ, â†ⱼ] = δᵢⱼ, [âᵢ, âⱼ] = 0
- Consequence: Symmetric wavefunctions, Bose-Einstein statistics

**Fermionic operators** (electrons, protons, helium-3, ...):
- Creation: b̂†ₖ, Annihilation: b̂ₖ
- Anticommutation relations: {b̂ᵢ, b̂†ⱼ} = δᵢⱼ, {b̂ᵢ, b̂ⱼ} = 0
- Consequence: Antisymmetric wavefunctions, Fermi-Dirac statistics, Pauli exclusion

**Spin-Statistics Theorem** (Pauli 1940):
- Integer spin (0, 1, 2, ...) → Bosons (commutation)
- Half-integer spin (1/2, 3/2, ...) → Fermions (anticommutation)
- Derived from relativistic QFT (Lorentz invariance + causality)

**This formalization**: Explores non-relativistic derivation from 3FLL + algebraic consistency.

## Approach Options (from Sprint 11 planning)

**Option A (Pragmatic)**: Accept spin as input, derive algebraic consequences
**Option B (Ambitious)**: Derive algebra from 3FLL + epistemic constraints
**Option C (Topological)**: Use 3D space topology (deferred)

**Sprint 11 strategy**: Hybrid (attempt Option B, fall back to Option A if needed)

## Operator Algebras

We formalize two distinct operator algebras for many-body quantum systems.

**Key observation**: These algebras are fundamentally different and cannot be mixed
within a single system without creating ill-defined propositions.

## Creation and Annihilation Operators

In second quantization, we represent quantum states using operators that create
and destroy particles in specific quantum states.

**Creation operator** â†ₖ: Adds one particle to quantum state k
**Annihilation operator** âₖ: Removes one particle from quantum state k

The commutation/anticommutation relations between these operators encode the
statistics of the particles.
-/

/-- Abstract creation operator for mode k

In computational implementation:
- Bosonic: Increases occupation number nₖ → nₖ + 1
- Fermionic: nₖ = 0 → 1, fails if nₖ = 1 (Pauli exclusion)
-/
axiom CreationOp : Type → Type

/-- Abstract annihilation operator for mode k

In computational implementation:
- Bosonic: Decreases occupation number nₖ → nₖ - 1
- Fermionic: nₖ = 1 → 0, fails if nₖ = 0
-/
axiom AnnihilationOp : Type → Type

/-!
## Commutator and Anticommutator

**Commutator**: [A, B] = AB - BA
- Measures failure of operators to commute
- Bosonic case: [aᵢ, a†ⱼ] = δᵢⱼ

**Anticommutator**: {A, B} = AB + BA
- Symmetric product of operators
- Fermionic case: {bᵢ, b†ⱼ} = δᵢⱼ
-/

/-- Commutator of two operators: [A, B] = AB - BA -/
axiom commutator {α : Type} : CreationOp α → AnnihilationOp α → ℂ

/-- Anticommutator of two operators: {A, B} = AB + BA -/
axiom anticommutator {α : Type} : CreationOp α → AnnihilationOp α → ℂ

## Canonical Commutation Relations (CCR) - Bosons

For bosonic operators:
- [âᵢ, â†ⱼ] = δᵢⱼ (creation and annihilation)
- [âᵢ, âⱼ] = 0 (two annihilations commute)
- [â†ᵢ, â†ⱼ] = 0 (two creations commute)

**Physical meaning**: Multiple bosons can occupy the same quantum state.
**Example**: Photons in a laser (all in same mode), Bose-Einstein condensate
-/

/-- Canonical commutation relation for bosonic operators -/
axiom bosonic_ccr {α : Type} [DecidableEq α] (i j : α) (a_i : AnnihilationOp α) (a_dag_j : CreationOp α) :
  commutator a_dag_j a_i = if i = j then (1 : ℂ) else (0 : ℂ)

/-!
## Canonical Anticommutation Relations (CAR) - Fermions

For fermionic operators:
- {b̂ᵢ, b̂†ⱼ} = δᵢⱼ (creation and annihilation)
- {b̂ᵢ, b̂ⱼ} = 0 (two annihilations anticommute)
- {b̂†ᵢ, b̂†ⱼ} = 0 (two creations anticommute)

**Physical meaning**: At most one fermion per quantum state (Pauli exclusion).
**Example**: Electrons in atoms, quarks in hadrons
-/

/-- Canonical anticommutation relation for fermionic operators -/
axiom fermionic_car {α : Type} [DecidableEq α] (i j : α) (b_i : AnnihilationOp α) (b_dag_j : CreationOp α) :
  anticommutator b_dag_j b_i = if i = j then (1 : ℂ) else (0 : ℂ)

/-!
## Pauli Exclusion Principle (from Fermionic CAR)

The anticommutation relations immediately imply Pauli exclusion.

**Proof**: If {b̂†ₖ, b̂†ₖ} = 0, then b̂†ₖ·b̂†ₖ = 0.
This means applying creation twice to the same state gives zero → impossible.

**Physical consequence**: Two identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state.
This explains:
- Atomic electron shells (Aufbau principle)
- Degeneracy pressure in white dwarfs/neutron stars
- Stability of matter (atoms don't collapse)
-/

/-- Pauli exclusion: Creating two fermions in same state gives zero -/
axiom pauli_exclusion {α : Type} (k : α) (b_dag_k : CreationOp α) :
  ∃ (zero_state : Type), True  -- Placeholder for b_dag_k·b_dag_k = 0

## Connection to Symmetry Type (Sprint 10 → Sprint 11 Bridge)

**Sprint 10 result**: Only symmetric OR antisymmetric states are well-defined.

**Sprint 11 goal**: Show algebraic structure determines symmetry type:
- Commutation algebra → Symmetric states (bosons)
- Anticommutation algebra → Antisymmetric states (fermions)

This connects operator formalism to wavefunction formalism.
-/

/-- Connection between algebra type and symmetry type -/

  | AlgebraType.Commutation => SymmetryType.Symmetric
  | AlgebraType.Anticommutation => SymmetryType.Antisymmetric

## Algebraic Purity Hypothesis (Core Sprint 11 Thesis)

**Hypothesis**: Mixed algebras (some operators commute, others anticommute)
lead to ill-defined propositions.

**Rationale**: Mixing algebras requires tracking which particles follow which
statistics, but indistinguishability means we can't persistently label particles.

**If provable**: This would derive the boson/fermion distinction from 3FLL +
epistemic constraints (Option B - ambitious goal).

**If not provable**: We accept spin as input and connect it to algebra type
(Option A - pragmatic fallback).
-/

/-- Hypothesis: Mixed algebras are inconsistent with well-defined propositions -/
axiom mixed_algebra_inconsistent :
  ∀ (a1 a2 : AlgebraType),
    a1 ≠ a2 →
    IndistinguishableParticles →
    ∃ (p : ParticleProp), ¬ WellDefinedProp p

/-!
## Main Theorem (Target): Algebraic Purity from 3FLL

**Goal**: Prove that 3FLL + indistinguishability → pure algebras only.

**Proof strategy**:
1. Assume mixed algebra (both commutation and anticommutation in same system)
2. Show this requires tracking which particles are bosonic vs fermionic
3. But indistinguishability forbids persistent particle labels
4. Contradiction → only pure algebras are consistent

**Status**: Axiomatized (proof deferred to Sprint 11 implementation)
-/

/-- Main theorem: Only pure operator algebras are consistent with indistinguishability -/
theorem algebraic_purity_from_epistemic_consistency :
  IndistinguishableParticles →
  ∀ (a1 a2 : AlgebraType),
    (∃ (p : ParticleProp), WellDefinedProp p) →
    a1 = a2 := by
  intro h_indist a1 a2 h_exists
  -- Proof by contradiction
  by_contra h_neq
  -- Mixed algebras create ill-defined propositions
  have h_mixed := mixed_algebra_inconsistent a1 a2 h_neq h_indist
  cases h_mixed with
  | intro p h_not_well_defined =>
    -- This contradicts h_exists (well-defined proposition exists)
    cases h_exists with
    | intro p' h_well_defined =>
      sorry  -- Complete proof: show p and p' must reference same algebra

/-!
## Connection to Fock Space

**Fock space**: Direct sum of n-particle Hilbert spaces.

For bosons: Symmetric tensor products (any occupation number)
For fermions: Antisymmetric tensor products (0 or 1 occupation)

This construction realizes the algebraic structure geometrically.
-/

/-- Fock space construction (placeholder for full formalization) -/
axiom FockSpace : AlgebraType → Type

/-- Bosonic Fock space allows arbitrary occupation numbers -/
axiom bosonic_fock_unbounded : ∀ (n : ℕ), True  -- Placeholder for nₖ ∈ ℕ

/-- Fermionic Fock space restricts to 0 or 1 occupation -/
axiom fermionic_fock_binary : ∀ (k : ℕ), True  -- Placeholder for nₖ ∈ {0, 1}

## Statistics and Counting (Bose-Einstein vs Fermi-Dirac)

The algebraic structure determines the statistical distribution of particles.

**Bose-Einstein statistics** (commutation algebra):
- Multiple particles per state allowed
- Distribution: nₖ = 1/(exp((εₖ - μ)/kT) - 1)
- Applications: Black-body radiation, superfluidity

**Fermi-Dirac statistics** (anticommutation algebra):
- At most one particle per state (Pauli exclusion)
- Distribution: nₖ = 1/(exp((εₖ - μ)/kT) + 1)
- Applications: Electron bands in solids, degeneracy pressure
-/

/-- Bose-Einstein vs Fermi-Dirac determined by algebra type -/
axiom statistics_from_algebra :
  ∀ (a : AlgebraType),
    algebra_to_symmetry a = SymmetryType.Symmetric ↔
    a = AlgebraType.Commutation

/-!
## Spin-Statistics Connection (Out of Scope / Partial)

**Standard result** (Pauli 1940):
- Integer spin (0, 1, 2, ...) → Commutation (bosons)
- Half-integer spin (1/2, 3/2, ...) → Anticommutation (fermions)

**Full derivation**: Requires relativistic QFT (Lorentz invariance + causality)

**PLF contribution** (this module):
- Derive algebraic purity from 3FLL (commutation OR anticommutation, not mixed)
- Document honest scope: spin → statistics connection requires additional structure
- Partial result is still publishable (reduces QM axiomatic basis)

**Future work** (Sprint 12+ or out of scope):
- Topological approach (Berry-Robbins, SO(3) exchange paths)
- Representation theory (Young diagrams, Schur-Weyl duality)
- Relativistic extension (full spin-statistics theorem)
-/

/-- Spin-statistics connection (postulated, not derived in PLF)

  Integer spin → Bosonic (commutation algebra)
  Half-integer spin → Fermionic (anticommutation algebra)
-/
axiom spin_statistics_postulate (spin : ℚ) (algebra : AlgebraType) :
  (∃ (n : ℤ), spin = n) →  -- Integer spin
    algebra = AlgebraType.Commutation  -- Bosonic

/-!
