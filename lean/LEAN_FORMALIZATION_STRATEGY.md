**Date**: October 6, 2025
**Purpose**: Prove novel theoretical contributions, axiomatize established results
**Goal**: Pass peer review with honest, rigorous formal verification

---

## Core Principle: Prove What's Novel, Axiomatize What's Established

### What We PROVE (Novel Contributions)

These are **our intellectual contributions** that must be formally verified:

1. **K(N) = N-2 from Maximum Entropy** (`Foundations/MaximumEntropy.lean`)
   - Prove the specific dimension formula from information-theoretic constraints
   - Three independent proof approaches available (Mahonian, Coxeter, MaxEnt)
   - **Status**: TO BE PROVEN (highest priority)

2. **Permutohedron Emergence from Information Space** (`Foundations/PermutohedronEmergence.lean`)
   - Prove that information space structure + logical filtering → permutohedron graph
   - Show adjacency = adjacent transpositions follows from constraints
   - **Status**: TO BE PROVEN

3. **Born Rule from Logical Constraints** (`QuantumEmergence/BornRuleProof.lean`)
   - Prove |ψ|² probability follows from PLF structure
   - Main novel result of the paper
   - **Status**: PARTIALLY DONE (needs completion)

4. **Uniqueness of Graph Laplacian as Hamiltonian** (`Dynamics/UniquenessTheorem.lean`)
   - Given the axiomatized results, PROVE H = L is the unique natural choice
   - This is the synthesis/integration argument
   - **Status**: TO BE PROVEN

### What We AXIOMATIZE (Established Literature)

These are **textbook/published results** we cite but don't re-prove:

1. **Fisher = Fubini-Study Metric** (`Dynamics/FisherGeometry.lean`)
   - Citation: Braunstein & Caves (1994), Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 3439
   - Standard result in quantum information geometry
   - **Status**: ✅ AXIOMATIZED

2. **Laplace-Beltrami → Graph Laplacian Convergence** (`Dynamics/ConvergenceTheorem.lean`)
   - Citation: Belkin & Niyogi (2008), NIPS
   - Deep result requiring extensive manifold analysis
   - **Status**: ✅ AXIOMATIZED

3. **Basic Graph Properties** (`Dynamics/GraphLaplacian.lean`)
   - Imported from Mathlib's `SimpleGraph.lapMatrix`
   - Symmetric, positive semidefinite, etc.
   - **Status**: ✅ IMPORTED FROM MATHLIB

## Module Structure (Logical Sequence)

### Phase 1: Foundations (NOVEL PROOFS)

**Priority order for formalization**:

```
PhysicalLogicFramework/
├── Foundations/
│   ├── InformationSpace.lean          [EXISTING - partially proven]
│   ├── ThreeFundamentalLaws.lean      [EXISTING - partially proven]
│   ├── MaximumEntropy.lean            [NEW - PROVE K(N) = N-2] ⭐ START HERE
│   └── PermutohedronEmergence.lean    [NEW - PROVE graph structure]
```

**MaximumEntropy.lean** - First target:
- Prove K(N) = N-2 from maximum entropy principle
- Use Mahonian statistics approach (most tractable)
- This is a concrete, verifiable mathematical result
- **Estimated effort**: 2-4 days

**PermutohedronEmergence.lean** - Second target:
- Prove information constraints → permutohedron graph
- Show adjacent transposition structure emerges
- Connects information theory to geometry
- **Estimated effort**: 3-5 days

### Phase 2: Quantum Emergence (NOVEL PROOFS)

```
PhysicalLogicFramework/
├── QuantumEmergence/
│   ├── HilbertSpace.lean              [EXISTING - needs completion]
│   ├── BornRule.lean                  [EXISTING - needs completion]
│   └── BornRuleProof.lean             [NEW - PROVE Born rule from PLF] ⭐
```

**BornRuleProof.lean** - Third target:
- Complete formal proof of Born rule from logical constraints
- Main result of the paper
- Builds on existing partial proofs
- **Estimated effort**: 5-7 days

### Phase 3: Dynamics (AXIOMS + SYNTHESIS)

```
PhysicalLogicFramework/
├── Dynamics/
│   ├── GraphLaplacian.lean            [EXISTING - basic structure] ✅
│   ├── FisherGeometry.lean            [EXISTING - axiomatized] ✅
│   ├── ConvergenceTheorem.lean        [EXISTING - axiomatized] ✅
│   ├── TheoremD1.lean                 [EXISTING - skeleton]
│   └── UniquenessTheorem.lean         [NEW - PROVE H = L uniqueness] ⭐
```

**UniquenessTheorem.lean** - Fourth target:
- GIVEN the axiomatized results (Fisher = FS, LB → GL)
- PROVE that H = L is the unique natural Hamiltonian
- This is the intellectual synthesis argument
- **Estimated effort**: 4-6 days

### Phase 4: Integration

```
PhysicalLogicFramework/
├── MainTheorem.lean                   [NEW - integrate everything]
└── PhysicalLogicFramework.lean        [UPDATE - import structure]
```

**MainTheorem.lean** - Final integration:
- Import all novel proofs + axiomatized results
- State and prove complete PLF theorem
- Show logical flow: Information → Geometry → Quantum → Dynamics
- **Estimated effort**: 2-3 days

## Presentation Strategy for Paper

### Supplementary Materials Section

**Title**: "Formal Verification in Lean 4"

**Opening paragraph**:

> We provide a Lean 4 formalization of the Physical Logic Framework, distinguishing between novel theoretical contributions (which we prove) and established results from the literature (which we axiomatize with citations). This approach follows standard mathematical practice: we formally verify our logical arguments while standing on the shoulders of established differential geometry and information theory.

### Structure in Paper

**Table: Formalization Status**

| Component | Type | Status | Reference |
|-----------|------|--------|-----------|
| K(N) = N-2 formula | **PROVEN** | ✅ Verified | Novel result |
| Permutohedron emergence | **PROVEN** | ✅ Verified | Novel result |
| Born rule derivation | **PROVEN** | ✅ Verified | Novel result (main) |
| H = L uniqueness | **PROVEN** | ✅ Verified | Novel synthesis |
| Fisher = Fubini-Study | Axiomatized | ✅ Cited | Braunstein & Caves 1994 |
| Laplace-Beltrami convergence | Axiomatized | ✅ Cited | Belkin & Niyogi 2008 |
| Graph Laplacian properties | Imported | ✅ Mathlib | Standard graph theory |

### Key Points for Reviewers

1. **Intellectual honesty**: We clearly distinguish our contributions from established results
2. **Computational verification**: Novel results are machine-checked, not hand-waved
3. **Reproducibility**: Complete formalization available in public repository
4. **Standard practice**: Like importing `numpy` vs reimplementing linear algebra
5. **Value added**: Catches logical errors, ensures consistency, enables extension

## Implementation Timeline

### Immediate (Week 2-3)
- ✅ Foundations infrastructure (Sprints 1-3 complete)
- 🔄 **MaximumEntropy.lean** - K(N) = N-2 proof (START HERE)

### Short-term (Week 3-4)
- PermutohedronEmergence.lean
- UniquenessTheorem.lean

### Medium-term (Month 2)
- BornRuleProof.lean completion
- Integration and documentation

### Long-term (Optional)
- Prove more axioms if Mathlib develops Riemannian geometry support
- Extend to dynamics (Schrödinger equation)

## Success Criteria

### For Peer Review
✅ **Novel results formally proven** (not axiomatized)
✅ **Clear citation of established results**
✅ **Honest presentation** in paper
✅ **Complete, buildable formalization**

### Technical
✅ **All novel proofs have 0 `sorry`**
✅ **Axioms clearly marked with literature citations**
✅ **Full project builds without errors**
✅ **Documentation explains strategy**

## Why This Will Pass Peer Review

1. **Standard practice**: Mathematicians axiomatize theorems from other papers routinely
   - "Using the result of [Author, Year], we prove..."
   - This is how mathematics builds incrementally

2. **Clear contribution**: Shows exactly what's new vs what's established
   - Reviewers can evaluate our specific claims
   - Prevents "reinventing the wheel" criticism

3. **Formal rigor where it counts**: Proves OUR theoretical claims
   - Born rule derivation is formally verified
   - K(N) = N-2 is machine-checked
   - Logical structure is type-safe

4. **Honest and transparent**: Reviewers respect intellectual honesty
   - Better than overclaiming
   - Shows scientific maturity

5. **Practical and efficient**: Uses formal methods appropriately
   - Proves novel results (valuable)
   - Doesn't waste time re-proving textbooks (pragmatic)

## Next Steps

1. **Document review**: Get feedback on this strategy
2. **Start MaximumEntropy.lean**: Prove K(N) = N-2 (most tractable)
3. **Update README**: Point to this strategy document
4. **Update CURRENT_STATUS.md**: Reflect new priorities
