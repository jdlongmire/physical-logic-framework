# Theorem D.1 Lean Formalization Plan

**Created**: October 5, 2025
**Purpose**: Formalize Theorem D.1 (Graph Laplacian Hamiltonian) in Lean 4
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Required for paper integrity
**Timeline**: 5 phases (sprints)

---

## Why This Is Necessary

**Paper Integrity Issue**:
- Paper claims "formal verification in Lean 4 achieves 82% completion"
- Current 82% only covers OLD work (Born rule, MaxEnt, S_3/S_4 enumeration)
- **Theorem D.1 is NOT formalized** - only markdown proofs exist
- Theorem D.1 is the answer to "ad hoc Hamiltonian" criticism - MUST be rigorous
- Cannot claim formal verification if our newest, most important result isn't verified

**Current Gap**:
- ✅ **Formalized**: Born rule, MaxEnt, state enumeration (82%)
- ❌ **Not formalized**: Theorem D.1 (all 3 parts), K(N)=N-2 triple proof, graph Laplacian

## Theorem D.1 Structure (What to Formalize)

### Part 1: Fisher Metric = Fubini-Study Metric

**Mathematical Statement**:
```
g_F = 4 × g_FS
```
Where:

   - Riemannian metrics
   - Variational calculus
   - Graph theory (adjacency, Laplacian)

2. **Define core structures**:
   ```lean
   -- Graph Laplacian

     DegreeMatrix G - AdjacencyMatrix G

   -- Fisher information metric (basic definition)
   def FisherMetric (p : ProbabilityDistribution Ω) : QuadraticForm ℝ :=
     ...

   ```lean
   -- Fisher metric tensor
   def FisherMetric.tensor (p : ProbabilityDistribution Ω)
       : TangentSpace p →L[ℝ] TangentSpace p →L[ℝ] ℝ :=
     fun v w => ∑ i, (v i * w i) / p i
   ```

2. **Fubini-Study metric** (on projective Hilbert space):

       (h : p = born_rule ψ) :
     FisherMetric p = 4 • FubiniStudyMetric ψ :=
     by sorry
   ```

   def LaplaceBeltrami (M : Manifold) (g : RiemannianMetric M)
       : Operator (SmoothFunctions M) :=
     ...
   ```

   - Update paper claims accordingly

**Deliverable**: `PhysicalLogicFramework/Dynamics/TheoremD1.lean`

**Completion Criteria**: All three parts integrated, `lake build` succeeds, verification percentage calculated, paper updated

## Sprint Dependencies & Sequence

**Sprint 1** → **Sprint 2** → **Sprint 3** → **Sprint 4** → **Sprint 5**

**Critical Path**:
- Sprint 1 must complete before Sprint 2 (need to know Mathlib capabilities)
- Sprint 2 Part 1 blocks Sprint 5 (need metric structures)
- Sprint 3 Part 2 can proceed in parallel with Sprint 4
- Sprint 5 requires Sprint 2, 3, and 4 complete

**Decision Points** (gates between sprints):
- **After Sprint 1**: Decide on custom vs. Mathlib differential geometry
- **After Sprint 2**: Decide if Part 1 needs axioms
- **After Sprint 3**: Decide if Belkin & Niyogi should be axiomatized
- **After Sprint 4**: Assess overall proof completeness

---

## Mathlib Dependencies to Investigate

### Existing Support (to check):
- `Mathlib.Analysis.Calculus.FDeriv` - Functional derivatives
- `Mathlib.Geometry.Manifold.VectorBundle` - Tangent spaces
- `Mathlib.Geometry.Manifold.Instances.Sphere` - Projective spaces?
- `Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.QuadraticForm` - Quadratic forms
- `Mathlib.Data.Matrix.Basic` - Matrix operations
- `Mathlib.Combinatorics.SimpleGraph.Basic` - Graph theory
- `Mathlib.Analysis.Calculus.LagrangeMultipliers` - Constrained optimization

### May Need to Build:
- Fisher information metric (likely not in Mathlib)
- Fubini-Study metric (may be in projective geometry)
- Laplace-Beltrami operator (partial support?)
- Graph Laplacian (basic definition exists)
- Belkin & Niyogi convergence (definitely not in Mathlib)

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (may require axioms or extensive work):
- ⚠️ **Laplace-Beltrami → Graph Laplacian convergence**: Complex analysis, may need to axiomatize Belkin & Niyogi (2008) result
- ⚠️ **Variational calculus**: Functional derivatives underdeveloped in Mathlib
- ⚠️ **Projective Hilbert space**: May need custom formalization

### Medium Risk (significant but feasible):
- ⚡ **Fisher information metric**: Can define from first principles
- ⚡ **Fubini-Study metric**: May exist in Mathlib projective geometry
- ⚡ **Graph Laplacian**: Basic definition straightforward

### Low Risk (should be straightforward):
- ✅ **Graph structure**: Permutohedron as Cayley graph
- ✅ **Matrix operations**: Well-supported in Mathlib
- ✅ **Basic eigenvalue theory**: Complete in Mathlib

---

## Axiom Strategy

**Philosophy**: Minimize axioms, but accept them when:
1. Result is proven in literature (cite paper)
2. Full formalization would take months
3. Axiom is clearly stated and defensible

**Acceptable axioms**:
- Belkin & Niyogi (2008) convergence theorem (proven rigorously in literature)
- Advanced differential geometry results (if Mathlib incomplete)

**Unacceptable axioms**:
- Core claims (Fisher = Fubini-Study, min Fisher → Hamiltonian)
- Basic graph properties
- Anything not proven in literature

---

## Success Criteria

**Minimum (acceptable for submission)**:
- ✅ Graph Laplacian formalized (H = D - A)
- ✅ Fisher metric formalized (basic definition)
- ✅ Fubini-Study metric formalized (or axiomatized if needed)
- ✅ Part 1 proven OR axiomatized with clear citation
- ✅ Part 2 axiomatized (citing Belkin & Niyogi)
- ✅ Part 3 core steps proven (Euler-Lagrange → eigenvalue equation)
- ✅ Integration theorem stated

**Target (ideal)**:
- ✅ All three parts fully proven
- ✅ Minimal axioms (only Belkin & Niyogi convergence)
- ✅ Complete eigenvalue characterization
- ✅ Computational verification matches Lean proofs

**Stretch (aspirational)**:
- ✅ K(N) = N-2 formalized (one of three proofs)
- ✅ Time evolution (i∂_t ψ = Hψ) formalized
- ✅ Unitary evolution proven

---

## Execution Sequence

**Sprint-Based Approach** (not time-boxed):

1. **Sprint 1: Foundation & Infrastructure** → *Complete when graph Laplacian defined and Mathlib surveyed*
2. **Sprint 2: Differential Geometry** → *Complete when Fisher/Fubini-Study metrics formalized*
3. **Sprint 3: Convergence Theory** → *Complete when Laplace-Beltrami → Graph Laplacian proven/axiomatized*
4. **Sprint 4: Variational Calculus** → *Complete when Euler-Lagrange → Hamiltonian proven*
5. **Sprint 5: Integration** → *Complete when all parts integrated and verified*

**Parallel Work** (can overlap):
- Sprint 3 and Sprint 4 can proceed simultaneously (independent mathematical content)
- Documentation and testing throughout (not saved for end)

**Estimate** (for planning only, not commitment):
- Optimistic: All sprints complete in 2-3 weeks calendar time
- Realistic: All sprints complete in 3-5 weeks calendar time
- Pessimistic: All sprints complete in 6-8 weeks if major Mathlib gaps found

**Key principle**: Progress is measured by completion criteria, not time elapsed

---

## Paper Implications

### Current Paper Claim:
> "Formal verification in Lean 4 achieves 82% completion for core theorems"

### After Formalization:
**If successful (all parts proven)**:
> "Formal verification in Lean 4 achieves ~92% completion for core theorems, including Theorem D.1 (graph Laplacian emergence from Fisher information geometry)"

**If partial (some axioms needed)**:
> "Formal verification in Lean 4 achieves ~85% completion for core theorems. Theorem D.1 structure is formalized with key steps proven; convergence results (Belkin & Niyogi 2008) are axiomatized pending full Mathlib support for Riemannian geometry."

### Honest Approach:
- State axioms clearly in paper appendix
- Cite literature for axiomatized results
- Emphasize what IS proven vs. what relies on literature
- This is still far more rigorous than typical physics papers

---

## Sprint 1 Kickoff (First Tasks)

**Phase**: Foundation & Infrastructure

**Tasks** (in order):

1. **Mathlib Reconnaissance**:
   - Search for differential geometry modules
   - Check existing graph Laplacian implementations
   - Assess variational calculus tools
   - Document what exists vs. what we need to build

2. **Lean File Scaffolding**:
   - Create `PhysicalLogicFramework/Foundations/GraphLaplacian.lean`
   - Create `PhysicalLogicFramework/Dynamics/FisherGeometry.lean`
   - Create `PhysicalLogicFramework/Dynamics/TheoremD1.lean`
   - Set up imports and module structure

3. **Graph Laplacian Definition** (lowest-hanging fruit):
   - Define L = D - A for simple graphs
   - Prove L is symmetric
   - Prove L is positive semidefinite
   - Apply to permutohedron graph

4. **Sprint 1 Completion Gate**:
   - Run `lake build` to verify compilation
   - Document Mathlib findings
   - Decide: build on Mathlib or custom structures?
   - Update Sprint 2 plan based on findings

**Sprint 1 is complete when**: Graph Laplacian formalized, basic properties proven, Mathlib capabilities assessed

---

## Conclusion

**This is necessary work.** We cannot claim formal verification if our most important new result (Theorem D.1) isn't formalized.

**Key insight**: We don't need to prove everything from scratch. Axiomatizing well-established literature results (Belkin & Niyogi) is scientifically honest and defensible. The core claims (Fisher = Fubini-Study, min Fisher → Hamiltonian) must be proven.

**Sprint-based approach**: Progress is measured by completion criteria, not calendar time. Each sprint has clear deliverables and decision gates. This allows us to adapt strategy as we learn more about Mathlib capabilities.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with formalization. This is the right decision for paper integrity.

---

**Plan Status**: Ready for Sprint 1 execution
**Risk Level**: Medium-High (complex mathematics, Mathlib gaps unknown)
**Priority**: CRITICAL (blocks paper submission with integrity)
