# ValidArrangements(3) Inconsistency Fix

**Date**: 2025-01-03
**Research Phase**: Theory Completion - Phase 1, Task 1
**Priority**: Critical (foundational)

---

## Problem Identified

**Inconsistency between Lean modules:**
- **FeasibilityRatio.lean**: Correctly stated `ValidArrangements 3 = 3`
- **PermutationGeometry.lean**: Incorrectly stated `ValidArrangements 3 = 2`

This created a type error because PermutationGeometry imports from FeasibilityRatio but claimed a different value.

## Ground Truth Determination

**Systematic enumeration of S₃ with constraint K=1 (inversion count ≤ 1):**

| Permutation | Inversions | Count | Valid (≤1)? |
|-------------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| (1,2,3) | none | 0 | ✓ |
| (1,3,2) | (2,3) | 1 | ✓ |
| (2,1,3) | (1,2) | 1 | ✓ |
| (2,3,1) | (1,3), (2,3) | 2 | ✗ |
| (3,1,2) | (1,2), (1,3) | 2 | ✗ |
| (3,2,1) | (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) | 3 | ✗ |

**Result**: ValidArrangements(3) = 3 ✓

**Constraint**: K = LFTConstraintThreshold(3) = 1 (from FeasibilityRatio.lean line 70)

**Inversion Count Definition**: For positions i < j, count when σ(i) > σ(j) (values out of order)

## Fix Applied

**File**: `lean/LFT_Proofs/PhysicalLogicFramework/PermutationGeometry.lean`

**Changes**:
- Line 65: `ValidArrangements 3 = 2` → `ValidArrangements 3 = 3`
- Line 96: `valid_arrangements = 2` → `valid_arrangements = 3`
- Lines 128, 157: Similar corrections (via replace_all)

**Verification**: Both files now consistently state `ValidArrangements 3 = 3` ✓

---

## Status

**Type Consistency**: ✅ Resolved
- FeasibilityRatio.lean: ValidArrangements 3 = 3
- PermutationGeometry.lean: ValidArrangements 3 = 3

**Module Compilation**: ⚠️ FeasibilityRatio.lean has pre-existing proof errors (unrelated to this fix)
- These are incomplete proofs with `sorry` placeholders
- Will be addressed in Phase 2 (complete N=3 proofs)

---

## Impact

**Foundation for Future Work**:
- Unblocks Lean proof completion (Phase 2)
- Establishes correct constraint counting baseline
- Enables accurate feasibility ratio calculations

**Research Roadmap Progress**:
- ✅ **Phase 1, Task 1**: Fix ValidArrangements(3) inconsistency (COMPLETE)
- Next: Phase 2 - Remove `sorry` from N=3 proofs

---

## Mathematical Significance

This fix confirms the correct constraint counting for N=3 systems:
- **Feasibility ratio**: ρ₃ = 3/6 = 1/2
- **Physical interpretation**: Half of all S₃ permutations satisfy constraint K=1
- **Quantum connection**: Relates to 3-state quantum system (Section 4.1.2 of paper)

The three valid permutations {(1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3)} correspond to the quantum state:
```
|ψ⟩ = (1/√3)[|(1,2,3)⟩ + |(1,3,2)⟩ + |(2,1,3)⟩]
```

With Born probabilities P = |⟨σ|ψ⟩|² = 1/3 for each valid state.
