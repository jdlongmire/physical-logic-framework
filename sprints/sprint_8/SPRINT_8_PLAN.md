# Sprint 8: Logic_Realism Integration & Renumbering

**Sprint**: 8 (Week 5, Post-Sprint 7 Integration)
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Status**: Planning
**Type**: Refactoring & Integration Sprint

---

## Executive Summary

Sprint 8 is a **critical integration sprint** to properly incorporate Sprint 7's measurement theory work into the canonical Logic_Realism notebook suite. This sprint will:

1. **Migrate** 4 notebooks from `approach_1` to `Logic_Realism` with V2 architecture adaptation
2. **Renumber** existing Logic_Realism notebooks 06-13 → 10-17 to maintain sequential flow
3. **Update** all Lean proof references to match new numbering
4. **Deprecate** the `approach_1` folder to eliminate fragmentation
5. **Validate** that all notebooks, Lean proofs, and cross-references are correct

**Result**: A single, coherent Logic_Realism suite (00-17, 18 total notebooks) with proper pedagogical flow from foundations → dynamics → measurement → applications.

---

## Background: Why This Sprint is Necessary

### The Problem Identified

During Sprint 7, measurement theory notebooks were created in `notebooks/approach_1/` instead of `notebooks/Logic_Realism/`. This created:

1. **Fragmentation**: Two parallel notebook suites with unclear relationship
2. **Pedagogical Gap**: Logic_Realism Notebook 05 promises Schrödinger derivation in "Next Steps" but never delivers
3. **Missing Prerequisites**: Notebooks 06-08 (Interferometry, Qubits, Energy Levels) assume time evolution without deriving it
4. **Lean Reference Mismatch**: New Lean files (QuantumDynamics.lean, MeasurementMechanism.lean) reference approach_1 notebook numbers

### The Solution

**Integrate Sprint 7 work into Logic_Realism** by:
- Inserting new notebooks 06-09 (Schrödinger + Measurement)
- Renumbering existing 06-13 → 10-17
- Updating all references to maintain consistency
- Deprecating approach_1 to enforce single source of truth

---

## Sprint 8 Goals

### Primary Goals

1. ✅ **Migrate Content**: Adapt approach_1 notebooks 15-18 to Logic_Realism V2 architecture
2. ✅ **Renumber Sequential**: Maintain strict 00-17 numbering with no gaps
3. ✅ **Update Lean Proofs**: All Lean files reference correct notebook numbers
4. ✅ **Validate Builds**: All notebooks execute, all Lean modules build successfully
5. ✅ **Deprecate approach_1**: Rename to `approach_1_deprecated`, update all documentation

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Logic_Realism has 18 sequential notebooks (00-17)
- [ ] Notebooks 06-09 fill the pedagogical gap (Schrödinger + Measurement)
- [ ] All Lean proof references match new numbering
- [ ] All notebooks execute without errors
- [ ] All Lean modules build with 0 sorry
- [ ] README files reflect new structure
- [ ] approach_1 folder renamed to approach_1_deprecated with explanation

# DEPRECATED: approach_1 Notebooks

**Status**: DEPRECATED as of Sprint 8 (October 11, 2025)

This folder has been deprecated. All active development now occurs in `notebooks/Logic_Realism/`.

## Migration Summary

The following notebooks were migrated to Logic_Realism:

- approach_1/15 → Logic_Realism/06 (Schrödinger from Fisher Metric)
- approach_1/16 → Logic_Realism/07 (Measurement as Constraint Addition)
- approach_1/17 → Logic_Realism/08 (Observer & Decoherence)
- approach_1/18 → Logic_Realism/09 (Toy Model Measurement Cycle)

## Why Deprecated?

- **Single Source of Truth**: Logic_Realism is the canonical notebook suite
- **Fragmentation**: Multiple parallel suites created confusion
- **Lean Integration**: All Lean proofs now reference Logic_Realism numbering

## Historical Context

This folder contains the original Sprint 7 work (October 10, 2025) before integration into Logic_Realism. It is preserved for historical reference only.

**Do not use these notebooks for active development or citations.**

## Risk Assessment

### Risks

1. **Notebook Execution Failures**
   - **Likelihood**: Low
   - **Impact**: Medium
   - **Mitigation**: Test each notebook after migration before renumbering

2. **Lean Build Failures**
   - **Likelihood**: Low
   - **Impact**: High
   - **Mitigation**: Update Lean files early, test builds frequently

3. **Cross-Reference Breakage**
   - **Likelihood**: Medium
   - **Impact**: Medium
   - **Mitigation**: Use search to find all references, validate systematically

4. **File Collision During Renumbering**
   - **Likelihood**: Low
   - **Impact**: Low
   - **Mitigation**: Rename in reverse order (13→17, 12→16, etc.)

### Contingency Plans

**If migration fails:**
- Revert to git branch pre-migration state
- Debug individual notebooks
- Migrate incrementally (one at a time)

**If Lean builds fail:**
- Revert Lean file changes
- Update references one file at a time
- Test build after each change

---

## Post-Sprint Actions

After Sprint 8 completion:

1. **Git Commit & Push**
   - Commit all changes with detailed message
   - Push to remote repository
   - Create tag: `v2.0-logic-realism-complete`

2. **Update Session Log**
   - Document Sprint 8 completion in Session_X.Y.md
   - Note migration success and new structure

3. **Paper Updates** (if needed)
   - Update any paper sections citing notebook numbers
   - Update supplementary material references

4. **Sprint 9 Planning**
   - With Logic_Realism complete (18 notebooks), plan next phase
   - Consider field theory extensions or experimental proposal writing

---

## Integration with Previous Sprints

- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Impact**: None (notebooks 00-05 unchanged)

### Sprint 7 (Weeks 3-4): Measurement Theory + Quantum Dynamics
