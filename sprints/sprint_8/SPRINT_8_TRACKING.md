# Sprint 8 Tracking: Logic_Realism Integration & Renumbering

**Sprint**: 8 (Week 5)
**Focus**: Integration & Refactoring
**Started**: October 10, 2025
**Status**: In Progress

---

## Sprint Goals

### Primary Objective
Integrate Sprint 7 measurement theory work into canonical Logic_Realism notebook suite with proper sequential numbering.

### Specific Goals
1. ✅ Migrate 4 notebooks from approach_1 to Logic_Realism (06-09)
2. ✅ Renumber existing Logic_Realism notebooks 06-13 → 10-17
3. ✅ Update all Lean proof references to match new numbering
4. ✅ Deprecate approach_1 folder to eliminate fragmentation
5. ✅ Validate all notebooks execute and Lean builds succeed

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Logic_Realism has 18 sequential notebooks (00-17)
- [ ] All notebooks execute without errors
- [ ] All Lean modules build with 0 sorry
- [ ] approach_1 renamed to approach_1_deprecated
- [ ] All documentation updated

## Daily Log

### Day 1 - October 10, 2025

**Phase 1: Preparation** ⏳

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Created Sprint 8 plan (SPRINT_8_PLAN.md)
- [x] Created quick reference guide (SPRINT_8_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
- [x] Analyzed V2 architecture compliance (✅ approach_1 notebooks already compliant)
- [x] Identified Lean files needing updates (3 files, 14 references)
- [x] Created Sprint 8 folder structure
- [ ] Create git branch: sprint-8-integration
- [ ] Document pre-migration state

**Notebook Track**: Planning complete
**Lean Track**: Analysis complete (3 files identified)
**Documentation Track**: Planning docs created

**Team Track**: N/A (refactoring sprint)

**Integration Notes**:
- approach_1 notebooks already follow V2 architecture ✅
- Migration work reduced from 12-16 hours → 8-12 hours estimate
- Focus on cross-reference updates and polishing

**Next Actions**:
- Create git branch
- Begin Phase 2: Migration (notebooks 15-18 → 06-09)

   - Status: Planned

2. **Lean build failures after reference updates**
   - Mitigation: Update and test one file at a time
   - Status: Planned

3. **Cross-reference breakage**
   - Mitigation: Systematic search and validation
   - Status: Planned

## Integration Notes

### Connection to Sprint 7
Sprint 8 directly builds on Sprint 7 deliverables:
- Sprint 7 created notebooks 15-18 in approach_1
- Sprint 8 migrates them to Logic_Realism 06-09
- Completes the measurement theory integration promised in Sprint 7

### Connection to Overall Project
This sprint resolves:
- **Peer Review Issue #2**: Measurement mechanism now in canonical location
- **Pedagogical gap**: Schrödinger equation derivation added (Notebook 05 promise fulfilled)
- **Fragmentation**: Single source of truth (Logic_Realism only)
- **Lean consistency**: All proofs reference same notebook numbering

---

## Next Sprint Handoff

### What's Ready
After Sprint 8 completion:
- Complete Logic_Realism suite (00-17, 18 notebooks)
- Fully validated measurement theory
- Consistent Lean proof library
- Clean repository structure

### Open Questions
- Field theory extensions (Sprint 9?)
- Experimental proposal writing
- Paper v2 integration with new notebooks

### Recommendations
- Consider Sprint 9: Field Theory Foundation (per original plan)
- OR: Paper v2 revision with measurement theory
- OR: Experimental proposal based on notebooks 13-15
