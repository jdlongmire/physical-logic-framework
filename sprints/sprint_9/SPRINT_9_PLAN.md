# Sprint 9: Mission Statement Refinement & Scope Alignment

**Sprint**: 9 (Week 5-6)
**Focus**: Conceptual foundation and honest scope documentation
**Started**: October 10, 2025
**Status**: Planning

---

## Sprint Objective

Refine the Physical Logic Framework mission statement to accurately reflect:
1. What has been rigorously derived (Born rule, Schrödinger equation, measurement mechanism)
2. What is in progress or partially developed (field theory, many-body systems)
3. What are known limitations with proposed resolutions (indistinguishable particles)
4. The relationship between philosophical foundation (3FLL) and mathematical implementation (S_N structures)

**Success Criteria**: All repository documentation aligned with refined mission; no overclaims; clear scope boundaries; honest assessment of current state vs. future roadmap.

## Background: Mission Statement Draft

User provided initial mission statement emphasizing:
- **Core concept**: "One Axiom (3FLL), One Postulate (Infinite Information Space I)"
- **Logic Realism Principle**: A = L(I) (Actualized Reality = Logical filtering of Information)
- **Two-pillar argument for 3FLL necessity**:
  - Empirical: No verified violations in all of science
  - Deductive: Gödel II → contingency → necessary pre-arithmetic foundation
- **Derivation claim**: "Entire structure of quantum mechanics" from this foundation

**Issues to address**:
1. Precision about scope ("entire structure" vs. "core principles")
2. Specification of Information Space I (abstract vs. I = ∏ S_n)
3. Gödel argument rigor (philosophical vs. formal)
4. Explicit falsification criteria
5. Acknowledgment of current limitations
6. Relationship between mission-level claims and technical implementation

## Phase 1: Mission Statement Refinement

### Deliverable 1.1: Refined Mission Statement Document

**File**: `MISSION_STATEMENT.md` (new, root level)

**Content sections**:

1. **Mission Statement** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - Dual mission: Decompose to primitives, derive QM from logic
   - Goal: Replace 5 QM postulates with "one axiom, one postulate" foundation
   - Emphasis: Explain *why* universe is quantum mechanical

2. **Core Conceptual Framework**
   - The Necessary Axiom: 3FLL with dual justification (empirical + deductive)
   - The Foundational Postulate: Infinite Information Space I
   - The Logic Realism Principle: A = L(I)
   - Mathematical Realization: I = ∏_{n=1}^∞ S_n, L = EM ∘ NC ∘ ID

3. **What Has Been Derived** (with references)
   - Born rule P = |ψ|² (Notebook 03, MaximumEntropy.lean)
   - Hamiltonian H = D - A (Notebook 05, GraphLaplacian.lean, TheoremD1.lean)
   - Schrödinger equation iℏ∂_t|ψ⟩ = Ĥ|ψ⟩ (Notebook 06, QuantumDynamics.lean)
   - Measurement mechanism (Notebooks 07-09, MeasurementMechanism.lean)
   - Interference, qubits, energy quantization (Notebooks 10-12)
   - Experimental predictions (Notebooks 13-15)

4. **Current Scope and Boundaries**
   - Successfully derived: Non-relativistic single-particle and distinguishable multi-particle QM
   - Partially developed: Hilbert space structure (geometric foundation clear, full operator algebra in progress)
   - Known limitations: Indistinguishable particle statistics (proposed resolution via Young diagrams, Sprint 10)
   - Future extensions: Quantum field theory, relativistic QM, gravitational emergence

5. **Falsification Criteria**
   - A = L(I) is empirically testable
   - Specific predictions that distinguish from standard QM:
     - Finite-N interference visibility: V(N) = 1 - π²/(12N) + O(1/N²)
     - Spectral gap scaling: Δ(N) = 2π²/[N(N-1)]
     - Entropy saturation: S_∞ = S_max/2 (Page limit)
   - Any confirmed violation of these predictions would require revision or rejection

6. **The Gödel Argument** (refined)
   - Present as "motivating argument" rather than "deductive proof"
   - Clarify: Suggests 3FLL as pre-arithmetic foundation
   - Primary justification remains empirical (no observed violations)
   - Full philosophical argument in supplementary material

**Estimated time**: 4-6 hours

---

### Deliverable 1.2: Scope Boundaries Document

**File**: `SCOPE_AND_LIMITATIONS.md` (new, root level)

**Content sections**:

1. **Derived with High Confidence** (0-2 sorrys in Lean, 100% computational validation)
   - List all theorems/results with Lean file + notebook references
   - Confidence level: "Rigorously proven"

2. **Derived with Moderate Confidence** (Strategic axioms in Lean, 100% computational validation)
   - Results that rely on axioms we believe can be proven
   - Confidence level: "Strong computational evidence, formal proof in progress"

3. **Hypothesized but Not Yet Formalized**
   - Exchange statistics from Young diagrams (Sprint 10 target)
   - Field theory emergence (future research)
   - Gravitational dynamics (proof-of-concept only)

4. **Known Limitations**
   - What the framework currently does NOT explain
   - Honest assessment with no hedging
   - Proposed resolution paths where applicable

5. **Relationship to Standard QM**
   - Where framework reproduces standard QM exactly
   - Where framework makes different predictions (finite-N effects)
   - N→∞ limit recovering standard QM

**Estimated time**: 2-3 hours

---

### Deliverable 1.3: Falsification Criteria Document

**File**: `FALSIFICATION_CRITERIA.md` (new, root level)

**Content sections**:

1. **Core Hypothesis**: A = L(I) is the fundamental claim

2. **Experimental Tests That Would Falsify**:
   - Test 1: Finite-N interference visibility
     - Prediction: V(N) = 1 - π²/(12N)
     - Falsification: Measured V(N) deviates by >3σ for N=3-10 systems

   - Test 2: Spectral gap in permutation-symmetric systems
     - Prediction: Δ(N) = 2π²/[N(N-1)]
     - Falsification: Gap scales differently (e.g., Δ ~ 1/N instead of 1/N²)

   - Test 3: Entropy saturation ceiling
     - Prediction: S_∞ = ½log(|V_K|) (Page curve)
     - Falsification: Entropy exceeds Page bound by >10% in clean systems

   - Test 4: 3FLL violation
     - Prediction: No physical system can violate Identity, Non-Contradiction, or Excluded Middle
     - Falsification: Reproducible observation of object non-identical to itself, or simultaneous P∧¬P

3. **Theoretical Tests That Would Falsify**:
   - Discovery of inconsistency in derivation chain
   - Proof that V_K structure does not support Hilbert space
   - Demonstration that H = D - A cannot recover standard Hamiltonians in continuum limit

4. **What Would NOT Falsify**:
   - Failure to derive field theory (out of current scope)
   - Failure to derive gravity (speculative extension)
   - Discovery that exchange statistics requires additional axioms (acknowledged gap)

**Estimated time**: 2-3 hours

## Phase 4: Multi-LLM Team Consultation

### Deliverable 4.1: Mission Statement Review

**Consultation topic**: "Physical Logic Framework Mission Statement - Critical Review"

**Prompt**:
```
The Physical Logic Framework claims to derive quantum mechanics from a "one axiom, one postulate" foundation:
- Axiom: Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL) are ontologically necessary
- Postulate: Infinite Information Space I = ∏ S_n exists
- Principle: A = L(I) (reality is logic-filtered information)

Attached: Refined mission statement, scope boundaries, falsification criteria

Please critically evaluate:
1. Is the scope accurately described (no overclaims)?
2. Are the limitations honestly acknowledged?
3. Is the Gödel argument for 3FLL necessity rigorous or overstated?
4. Are the falsification criteria concrete and testable?
5. What gaps or inconsistencies do you identify?
6. How does this compare to other "QM from first principles" programs (e.g., QBism, relational QM)?

Quality threshold: >0.70 consensus score
```

**File**: `multi_LLM/consultation/sprint_9_mission_review_20251010.txt`

**Estimated time**: 1 hour

## Integration with Sprint 10

Sprint 9 creates the foundation for Sprint 10 (exchange statistics):

**Sprint 9 outcome**: "Current limitation: Indistinguishable particle statistics not yet derived. Proposed resolution via Young diagram projection (Sprint 10 investigation)."

**Sprint 10 can then**:
- Build on clear scope boundaries
- Either resolve acknowledged gap (success) or refine limitation statement (honest update)
- Avoid overclaiming if hypothesis doesn't pan out

## Next Steps

**To begin Sprint 9**:
1. User approval of this plan
2. Create `sprints/sprint_9/` folder
3. Create `SPRINT_9_TRACKING.md`
4. Begin Phase 1: Mission statement refinement
5. Progressive updates to sprint tracking and session log
