# Sprint 9 Tracking

**Sprint**: 9 (Week 5-6)
**Focus**: Mission Statement Refinement & Scope Alignment
**Started**: October 11, 2025
**Status**: In Progress

---

## Sprint Goals

Refine the Physical Logic Framework mission statement to accurately reflect:
1. What has been rigorously derived (Born rule, Schrödinger equation, measurement mechanism)
2. What is in progress or partially developed (field theory, many-body systems)
3. What are known limitations with proposed resolutions (indistinguishable particles)
4. The relationship between philosophical foundation (3FLL) and mathematical implementation (S_N structures)

**Success Criteria**:
- All repository documentation aligned with refined mission
- No overclaims; clear scope boundaries
- Honest assessment of current state vs. future roadmap
- Team consultation >0.70 quality score
