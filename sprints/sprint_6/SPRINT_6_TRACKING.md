# Sprint 6 Tracking - Born Rule Circularity

**Sprint**: 6 (Weeks 1-2)
**Focus**: Address Born Rule Circularity (Critical Issue #1 from Peer Review)
**Started**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: In Progress

---

## Sprint Goals

### Primary Objective
Demonstrate that the Born Rule derivation is non-circular by proving that assumptions (especially unitary invariance and K(N)=N-2) are independent of quantum mechanics and emerge from principles more fundamental than QM.

### Deliverables
1. **Notebook 12**: Unitary Invariance Foundations (~3,500 words)
   - Derive unitary transformations from pure combinatorial symmetries
   - No Hilbert space assumptions
   - Geometric approach via permutohedron symmetries

2. **Notebook 13**: K(N)=N-2 from First Principles (~3,500 words)
   - Prove K(N)=N-2 emerges from information-theoretic requirements
   - Independent verification via graph theory
   - Show connection to MaxEnt without quantum assumptions

3. **Lean Module**: BornRuleNonCircularity.lean (~400 lines)
   - Formal proof of assumption independence
   - Verify derivation chain has no cycles
   - Prove K(N)=N-2 uniquely determined

### Success Metrics
- [ ] All team consultations score >0.70 average
- [ ] Lean module compiles with 0 `sorry` statements
- [ ] Notebooks validated by team review
- [ ] Clear logical chain: Combinatorics → Symmetries → Unitarity → Born Rule
- [ ] Sprint review: Team consensus "Accept" or "Minor Revision"

## Daily Log

### Day 1 - 2025-10-09

**Notebook Track**:
- Status: Creating Notebook 12 (Unitary Invariance Foundations) [In Progress]
- Plan: Structure based on team consultation guidance
- Sections: Permutohedron symmetries → Distance metrics → Entropy preservation → Unitarity uniqueness

**Lean Track**:
- Status: Module structure planned from consultation
- Plan: Define permutohedron, symmetries, distances, entropy preservation
- Priority: Small N (N=3) first, then generalize

**Team Track**:
- Consultation 1: [COMPLETE] "How can we derive unitary transformations from pure combinatorial symmetries?"
  - Quality: Grok 0.70/1.0, Gemini 0.55/1.0, ChatGPT 0.34/1.0
  - Average: 0.53/1.0 (Grok meets threshold)
  - Key insight: Derive from distance preservation + entropy preservation → uniquely determines unitary structure
  - Saved: consultation_01_unitary_20251009_085455.txt/json

**Integration**:
- Team consultation provides clear roadmap for both notebook and Lean tracks
- Grok's response gives mathematical outline (7 theorems/lemmas)
- Gemini's response reinforces approach with Coxeter group emphasis
- Notebook will implement computational validation (N=3,4)
- Lean will formalize key theorems starting with permutohedron structure

**Key Guidance from Team**:
1. Start with permutohedron Cayley graph (adjacent transpositions)
2. Define Kendall tau / inversion distance (provably preserved by S_N symmetries)
3. Show transformations preserving distance + entropy must be bijective isometries
4. Map to vector space → these transformations correspond to unitary matrices
5. Prove uniqueness: only unitary structure satisfies all constraints

**Potential Pitfalls Identified**:
- Avoid implicit vector space assumptions before deriving them
- Ensure constraints (K(N)=N-2) justified combinatorially, not from QM
- Ground symmetries in graph-theoretic terms (Cayley graph automorphisms)
- Validate beyond small N to ensure generalization

**Next Steps**:
- Create Notebook 12 following team guidance
- Implement N=3, N=4 computational validation
- Begin Lean module planning with formalization priorities from team

## Key Questions Being Addressed

1. **Can unitary invariance be derived without assuming quantum mechanics?**
   - Approach: Start from symmetric group S_N and permutohedron geometry
   - Show unitary transformations emerge as natural symmetries of permutation space

2. **Is K(N)=N-2 independent of quantum structure?**
   - Approach: Derive from information-theoretic principles (MaxEnt, symmetry preservation)
   - Verify via graph theory (tree structure, spanning properties)

3. **Does the derivation chain have hidden circular dependencies?**
   - Approach: Formalize complete assumption hierarchy in Lean
   - Prove topological acyclicity of dependency graph

## Critical Peer Review Concerns Being Addressed

**From Grok (0.84/1.0)**:
> "The most pressing issue is the potential circularity in the derivation of the Born Rule (Theorem 5.1). The reliance on unitary invariance and other quantum-like assumptions suggests that the framework may not be deriving quantum mechanics from truly independent first principles."

**From Gemini (0.58/1.0)**:
> "The most critical concern is the potential for circularity in the derivation of the Born rule. Carefully examine the assumptions used in the derivation to ensure that they do not implicitly assume the Born rule or any equivalent principle."

**From ChatGPT (0.52/1.0)**:
> "The model seems to require a large number of assumptions, some of which are not well motivated... it's not clear why [K(N)=N-2] should be the case."

**Our Response Strategy**:
- Demonstrate each assumption emerges from combinatorics/information theory
- Provide rigorous Lean proof of independence
- Show explicit derivation path from first principles
