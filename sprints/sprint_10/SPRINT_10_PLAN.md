# Sprint 10: Exchange Statistics from Young Diagrams (DRAFT)

**Sprint**: 10 (Week 7-8)
**Focus**: Derivation of boson/fermion statistics from logical constraints
**Status**: Planning (pending Sprint 9 completion)

---

## Sprint Objective

Develop, test, and formalize the hypothesis that particle exchange statistics (bosons vs. fermions) emerge from logical filtering of symmetric group irreducible representations.

**Core Hypothesis**:
The Logical Field operator L acts on S_N Hilbert space by projecting onto the subspace spanned by fully symmetric (bosons) and fully antisymmetric (fermions) irreps only, eliminating mixed-symmetry Young diagrams as "logically contradictory."

**If successful**: Spin-statistics theorem becomes a derived result, not an axiom. Pauli exclusion principle emerges as a theorem of logical necessity.

---

## Background: The Indistinguishable Particle Gap

**Current status** (from NOTEBOOK_STATUS.md, papers):
- Framework successfully handles distinguishable particles
- Indistinguishable particles acknowledged as limitation (Section 8.4.1 of Logic Realism paper)
- Young tableaux structure explored but not formalized (Notebook 14 in old planning)

**User's hypothesis** (October 10, 2025):
```
L projects S_N Hilbert space onto symmetric ⊕ antisymmetric irreps
Mixed-symmetry Young diagrams are "logically contradictory"
Result: Only bosons (symmetric) and fermions (antisymmetric) allowed
Consequence: Pauli principle and Bose enhancement are theorems, not axioms
```

## Critical Questions to Answer

### Question 1: Which 3FLL is Violated by Mixed Symmetry?

**Three candidate arguments**:

**A. Non-Contradiction**: Mixed-symmetry states are "both symmetric and antisymmetric" in different indices, violating P ∧ ¬P

**B. Identity**: For truly identical particles, partial distinguishability (encoded in mixed-symmetry irreps) contradicts Identity principle

**C. Excluded Middle**: Exchange must be either sign-preserving (all symmetric) or sign-reversing (all antisymmetric); no middle ground allowed

**Sprint 10 Task**: Choose and rigorously develop one argument (or discover a fourth)

---

### Question 2: How Does h(σ) ≤ K(N) = N-2 Connect to Irrep Structure?

**Current framework**: V_K = {σ ∈ S_N : h(σ) ≤ N-2}

**Hypothesis**: L projects onto symmetric ⊕ antisymmetric

**Missing link**: Mathematical proof that these are equivalent (or clarify relationship)

**Possible conjectures**:
1. V_K naturally contains only symmetric + antisymmetric components
2. h(σ) ≤ N-2 is precisely the threshold where mixed-symmetry appears
3. h(σ) measures "degree of symmetry breaking"

**Sprint 10 Task**: Prove or refute one of these conjectures

---

### Question 3: What About Parastatistics?

**Standard QM**: Allows parafermions/parabosons with exchange phase e^(2πi/p), p > 2

**Hypothesis**: Only p=1 (bosons) and p=2 (fermions) allowed

**Two interpretations**:
- **Feature**: Framework predicts parastatistics cannot exist (falsifiable!)
- **Bug**: Framework too restrictive, rules out possible physics

**Sprint 10 Task**: Determine which interpretation is correct, add to falsification criteria

## Phase 4: Multi-LLM Team Consultation

### Deliverable 4.1: Young Diagram Hypothesis Review

**Consultation topic**: "Exchange Statistics from Young Diagrams - Critical Evaluation"

**Prompt**:
```
The Physical Logic Framework proposes a hypothesis for deriving particle exchange statistics:

Hypothesis: The Logical Field L projects S_N Hilbert space onto symmetric ⊕ antisymmetric irreps only, eliminating mixed-symmetry Young diagrams as "logically contradictory."

Consequence: Bosons (symmetric) and fermions (antisymmetric) emerge as the only allowed particle types. Pauli exclusion and Bose enhancement become theorems, not axioms.

Attached:
- Theoretical derivation document
- Computational validation notebook (N=3,4,5 tests)
- Lean formalization (if complete)

Please critically evaluate:
1. Is the logical argument rigorous? Which 3FLL is actually violated by mixed symmetry?
2. Is the mathematical connection between h(σ) ≤ N-2 and irrep structure proven or conjectured?
3. Do the computational tests validate or refute the hypothesis?
4. What are potential counterexamples or gaps in reasoning?
5. How does this compare to standard spin-statistics theorem derivations?
6. What observable predictions distinguish this from standard QM?
7. Overall assessment: Is this a breakthrough, a promising direction, or fundamentally flawed?

Quality threshold: >0.70 consensus score

## Success Metrics

**Sprint 10 Complete when**:
- ✅ Logical argument for mixed-symmetry elimination is rigorous (team consensus >0.70)
- ✅ Computational tests validate hypothesis (V_K has only symmetric + antisymmetric components for N=3,4,5)
- ✅ Pauli principle and Bose enhancement derived as theorems
- ✅ Lean formalization complete (0 sorrys or justified strategic axioms only)
- ✅ Observable predictions specified (falsification criteria)
- ✅ Papers updated to reflect resolved gap

**Outcome A** (Hypothesis validates):
- Major breakthrough: Spin-statistics is now derived, not postulated
- Scope update: "Complete non-relativistic QM" (no particle gap)
- Nature-level result if formalization is rigorous

**Outcome B** (Hypothesis refutes):
- Honest update: Indistinguishable particles remain a limitation
- Document: What we learned, why hypothesis failed, alternative approaches
- Maintain scientific integrity (negative results are valuable)

---

## Risk Assessment

**Risk 1**: Computational tests find significant mixed-symmetry components in V_K
- **Mitigation**: This would falsify hypothesis cleanly (valuable negative result)
- **Response**: Document why hypothesis failed, propose alternatives

**Risk 2**: Logical argument is circular or question-begging
- **Mitigation**: Team consultation will catch this
- **Response**: Refine argument or acknowledge as conjecture, not theorem

**Risk 3**: Lean formalization requires too many axioms
- **Mitigation**: Strategic axioms with justification are acceptable
- **Response**: Document axioms clearly, roadmap for future removal

**Risk 4**: Connection to h(σ) ≤ N-2 is unclear
- **Mitigation**: If necessary, treat as separate conditions (V_K + irrep projection)
- **Response**: Document both constraints, investigate relationship in future work

---

## Timeline

**Total estimated time**: 16-22 hours

**Phase breakdown**:
- Phase 1 (Theory): 6-8 hours
- Phase 2 (Computation): 4-5 hours
- Phase 3 (Lean): 3-4 hours
- Phase 4 (Consultation): 1 hour
- Phase 5 (Integration): 2-3 hours

**Week 7**: Phases 1-3 (theory, computation, Lean)
**Week 8**: Phases 4-5 (review, integration)

---

## Integration with Overall Program

**Sprint 9 → Sprint 10 flow**:
- Sprint 9 clarifies mission and scope boundaries
- Sprint 9 identifies indistinguishable particles as acknowledged gap
- Sprint 10 attempts to resolve gap with Young diagram hypothesis
- Either: Gap resolved (major win) or Gap refined (honest science)

**After Sprint 10**:
- If successful: Begin Sprint 11 (many-body systems, field theory)
- If unsuccessful: Document limitation, consider alternative approaches
- Either way: Framework has clearer scope and honest assessment
