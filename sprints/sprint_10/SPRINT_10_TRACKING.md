# Sprint 10 Tracking: Indistinguishable Particles - Epistemic Foundations

**Sprint Number**: 10
**Status**: In Progress
**Started**: 2025-10-14
**Focus**: Derive symmetrization postulate from 3FLL + epistemic constraints

---

## Sprint Overview

**Goal**: Extend Physical Logic Framework from distinguishable to indistinguishable particles using epistemic framing.

**Key Insight**: Indistinguishability is an **epistemic constraint** (information limit), not an **ontic state** (physical violation). The 3FLL apply to well-defined propositions about accessible information, not to particle ontology.

**Critical Reframing**:
- **OLD (Catastrophic)**: Mixed-symmetry states "violate 3FLL" → contradictions
- **NEW (Epistemic)**: Mixed-symmetry states require ill-defined propositions (persistent labels not epistemically accessible)

---

## Sprint 10 Scope (Groundwork)

### What We Derive

**Starting postulates**:
1. N indistinguishable particles exist (ontic level - particles are distinct entities)
2. Persistent particle labels are not epistemically accessible (information limit)
3. 3FLL (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle) apply to information structures

**Deliverable**:
- **Symmetrization postulate** derived from 3FLL + epistemic constraints
- Proof: Only symmetric OR antisymmetric states correspond to well-defined propositions
- Mixed-symmetry states require tracking information that doesn't exist

**Significance**: Reduces QM postulate count (symmetrization currently postulated, not derived)

### What We Defer (Sprint 11+)

**Remaining gaps** (honest scope limitation):
1. **Boson/Fermion distinction**: Why symmetric vs antisymmetric? (Spin-statistics theorem)
2. **Deeper algebraic structure**: Commutation vs anticommutation relations from 3FLL
3. **Testable predictions**: Decoherence, quantum-classical boundary

**Approach**: Accept spin-statistics as separate input for Sprint 10, explore algebraic structure in Sprint 11

## Team Consultation Results

**Consultation**: `sprint10_epistemic_reframe_20251014.json`
**Quality scores**: Grok 0.55, Gemini 0.55, ChatGPT 0.30
**Average**: 0.47 (all consultations cached, lower quality expected)

### Unanimous Team Verdicts

✅ **Epistemic framing is rigorous** (strong precedent in quantum foundations)
✅ **Resolves violation catastrophe** (ill-posed propositions, not axiom violations)
✅ **Consistent with standard QM** (derives symmetrization postulate)
✅ **Proceed with Sprint 10** (all three recommend YES)

### Team Recommendations

**Boson/Fermion Distinction**:
- **Grok**: Option A (accept spin-statistics input) - pragmatic, honest scope
- **Gemini**: Option B+D (explore algebraic structures) - ambitious future work
- **Decision**: Option A for Sprint 10, Option B for Sprint 11

**Lean Formalization**:
- **Grok**: Approach A (proposition-based) - direct link to 3FLL
- **Gemini**: Approach B (information algebra) - connects to standard QM
- **Decision**: Start with Approach A (simpler, faster), migrate to B if needed

**Key Literature**:
- QBism (C. Fuchs), Spekkens' toy model, Zeilinger (information interpretation)
- Rovelli (relational QM), Hardy (axiomatic QM)
- **Novel contribution**: Deriving symmetrization from 3FLL + epistemic constraints

- User caught potential 3FLL violation in original Sprint 10 hypothesis
- Initial team consultation confirmed catastrophic formulation
- Original: Mixed-symmetry "violates 3FLL" → contradictions

**Phase 2: Epistemic vs Ontic Reframing**
- User insight: "It's an epistemic limit, not an ontic state"
- Key distinction: N particles exist (ontic) but can't be labeled (epistemic)
- Sanity check: ✅ Resolves catastrophe, consistent with QM, fits LRT

**Phase 3: Team Consultation on Reframing**
- Consultation: `sprint10_epistemic_reframe_20251014.json`
- Team consensus: Proceed with epistemic framing ✅
- Quality: Grok 0.55, Gemini 0.55 (cache hit, lower scores expected)
- Recommendation: Sprint 10 (groundwork), Sprint 11 (boson/fermion)

**Phase 4: Sprint 10 Planning**
- Scope: Derive symmetrization postulate from 3FLL + epistemic constraints
- Approach: Lean Approach A (proposition-based), Notebook N=2,3 validation
- Defer: Spin-statistics theorem (Option A: accept as input)

## Integration Notes

### LRT ↔ PLF Connection

**LRT layer** (abstract):
- IIS (ℋ) = Infinite Information Space
- 3FLL (L) = Laws of Logic applied to information structures
- A = L(I) = Physical reality from logical consistency

**PLF layer** (concrete):
- IIS ≈ Symmetric group product with epistemic quotient
- 3FLL ≈ Well-definedness constraints on propositions
- A ≈ Symmetric/antisymmetric states only

**Sprint 10 contribution**: Extends PLF to indistinguishable particles via epistemic constraints

### Cross-Track Integration

**Lean → Notebook**:
- Lean formalizes logical derivation
- Notebook provides computational validation
- Both demonstrate: Mixed-symmetry = ill-defined propositions

**Notebook → Lean**:
- Notebook insights inform theorem structure
- Computational examples guide formalization
- Validation ensures correctness

**Both → Documentation**:
- Derivation paper integrates formal + computational
- Honest scope documentation for publication
- Clear LRT → PLF → Implementation hierarchy

---

## Success Metrics

**Completion criteria**:
- [ ] Lean module builds successfully (`lake build`)
- [ ] 0 sorry statements in `EpistemicStates.lean` and `YoungDiagrams.lean`
- [ ] Notebook executes without errors
- [ ] Team consultation on deliverables scores >0.70 average
- [ ] Clear documentation of honest scope (symmetrization ✅, spin-statistics deferred)

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks (aggressive but achievable for groundwork)

## Key Insights Gained

1. **Epistemic vs ontic distinction is critical**: Indistinguishability is about accessible information, not particle ontology
2. **Mixed-symmetry isn't forbidden**: It's ill-defined (like asking for exact position AND momentum)
3. **3FLL apply to propositions**: Not to particles themselves, but to well-defined statements about accessible information
4. **Symmetrization is derivable**: From logical consistency + epistemic constraints (reduces QM postulate count)
5. **Honest scope is strength**: Deriving symmetrization is significant even without full spin-statistics theorem

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **User caught critical flaw**: "Violation" language would have been catastrophic - epistemic reframing resolves it
2. **Team consultations validate**: Unanimous support for epistemic approach with clear scope
3. **Groundwork first**: Sprint 10 establishes foundations, Sprint 11 tackles harder problems
4. **Literature grounding matters**: QBism, Spekkens, Zeilinger provide precedent and context
