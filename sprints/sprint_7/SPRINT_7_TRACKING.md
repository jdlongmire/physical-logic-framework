# Sprint 7 Tracking - Measurement Theory + Lean Remediation

**Sprint**: 7 (Weeks 3-4)
**Focus**: Develop Measurement Mechanism & Continue Lean Proof Remediation
**Started**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Planning

## Sprint Goals

### Primary Objective (From Master Plan)
Construct concrete measurement mechanism with computational, formal, and team validation. Address Peer Review Issue #2 (Measurement & Wave Function Collapse).

### Secondary Objective (Lean Remediation)
Continue systematic remediation of Lean proofs, prioritizing high-impact modules that unlock dependent code.

### Dual-Track Approach
This sprint integrates two parallel streams:
1. **Measurement Theory Track**: New content (Notebooks 14-16, MeasurementMechanism.lean)

## Critical Peer Review Concerns Being Addressed

**From Master Plan - Issue #2 (Measurement)**:
> "The treatment of measurement is underdeveloped. While the paper discusses measurement-induced constraints, it doesn't provide a concrete mechanism for how wave function collapse occurs or how classical measurement outcomes emerge."

**Our Response Strategy (Sprint 7)**:
1. **Concrete Mechanism**: Notebook 14 implements constraint-addition model with computational validation
2. **Classical Emergence**: Notebook 15 shows how decoherence produces pointer states
3. **Worked Example**: Notebook 16 provides complete pedagogical demonstration
4. **Formal Proof**: MeasurementMechanism.lean proves Born rule emergence rigorously

**Integration with Remediation**:
- InformationSpace completion strengthens mathematical foundation
- TheoremD1 completion connects all three derivation paths (supports measurement theory)
- ConstraintAccumulation progress enables future quantum dynamics formalization

---

## Key Questions Being Addressed

### Measurement Theory
1. **How does wave function collapse occur in LFT?**
   - Approach: Measurement = adding K constraints to permutation space
   - Show constraint addition forces state localization

2. **What is an observer in this framework?**
   - Approach: Observer = system contributing constraints through coupling
   - Formalize observer role without anthropomorphic assumptions

3. **How do classical outcomes emerge?**
   - Approach: Decoherence through environmental constraint entanglement
   - Show einselection produces stable pointer states

### Lean Remediation
1. **Can we unlock all "complete but dependent" modules?**
   - Target: Complete InformationSpace → MaximumEntropy becomes production-ready
   - Target: Progress on ConstraintAccumulation → path to QuantumCore

2. **Can we prove Theorem D.1 completely?**
   - Target: Complete TheoremD1.lean (1 sorry remaining)
   - Impact: Major theoretical milestone

## Auditor Protocol Integration

**IMPORTANT**: This sprint follows Program Auditor Agent protocol (see CLAUDE.md).

**Before any claims**:
1. Run `grep -c sorry` on all modules
2. Verify `lake build` succeeds
3. Check dependency chains for sorry statements
4. Update statistics only with verified numbers

**Statistics Format**:
- ✅ "Module X has Y sorry statements (verified YYYY-MM-DD)"
- ✅ "Module builds successfully (verified YYYY-MM-DD)"
- ❌ NOT "Module is complete" without verification
