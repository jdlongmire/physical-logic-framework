## Theoretical Background

### Logic Realism Theory (LRT) Prediction

**From LRT_FORMALIZATION.md, Section 10 (Prediction 4)**:

- **Human consciousness**: High cognitive entropy H(ρ) = -Tr(ρ log ρ), full IIS (ℋ) access
  - Can conceptualize arbitrary superpositions, including "contradictions" like Schrödinger's cat
  - Flexible 3FLL application → creative phase manipulation, non-intuitive protocols

- **Artificial intelligence**: Low entropy, finite ℋ_sub ⊂ ℋ access
  - Limited to training data (quantum computing literature, standard protocols)
  - Rigid 3FLL enforcement → algorithmic optimization within known parameter space
  - Cannot access full IIS → limited creative leaps

**Prediction**: Humans design more effective erasure protocols by exploring non-standard phase relationships and gate sequences not present in training data.

### Quantum Eraser Fundamentals

**Wheeler's delayed-choice eraser** (conceptual):
1. Particle passes through double-slit
2. Which-path information recorded (interference destroyed)
3. **Eraser**: Information retroactively deleted (interference restored)

**Key insight**: Complementarity of wave-particle duality controlled by information availability.

**Implementation** (superconducting qubits):
- **System qubit** (S): Encodes path information (|0⟩ = path A, |1⟩ = path B)
- **Ancilla qubit** (A): Records which-path information
- **Erasure**: Controlled operation decouples A from S, erasing information
- **Measurement**: Check if interference restored

### 2025 Nobel Context (Superconducting Circuits)

**Technology**: Transmon qubits (Josephson junctions, superconducting resonators)

**Advantages**:
- High coherence times (T₁ ~ 100 μs, T₂ ~ 50 μs)
- Precise gate control (fidelity >99%)
- Scalable architecture (5-10 qubits accessible)

**Challenges**:
- Thermal noise (~50 mK dilution refrigerator)
- Decoherence from environment
- Cross-talk between qubits

**Opportunity**: Humans vs. AI optimize erasure in realistic noise conditions.

## Experimental Setup

### Hardware Requirements

**Quantum processor**:
- **Type**: Superconducting transmon qubits (Google Sycamore, IBM Quantum, Rigetti)
- **Qubits**: Minimum 2 (system + ancilla), ideal 3-4 (system + ancilla + environment qubits for noise modeling)
- **Connectivity**: All-to-all or linear chain with nearest-neighbor gates
- **Control**: Arbitrary single-qubit rotations (R_x, R_y, R_z), two-qubit gates (CNOT, CZ)
- **Readout**: High-fidelity measurement (>98% accuracy)

**Noise characteristics**:
- **T₁ (amplitude damping)**: 80-120 μs
- **T₂ (dephasing)**: 40-60 μs
- **Gate fidelity**: Single-qubit >99.9%, two-qubit >99.0%
- **Crosstalk**: <1% error between non-interacting qubits

**Calibration**:
- Daily recalibration of gate parameters
- Randomized benchmarking for fidelity estimation
- Process tomography for error characterization

### Software Requirements

**Quantum programming framework**:
- Qiskit (IBM), Cirq (Google), or PyQuil (Rigetti)
- Pulse-level control for fine-grained gate optimization

**AI system** (for comparison):
- **Architecture**: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent (PPO, SAC, or similar)
- **State representation**: Current gate sequence, noise parameters, visibility metric
- **Action space**: Gate selection (R_x, R_y, R_z, CNOT, CZ), parameter tuning (rotation angles)
- **Reward**: Visibility restoration ratio V_restored / V_original
- **Training data**: 10,000+ quantum circuits from literature (arXiv, PRL, Nature, Science)
- **Training time**: 1-2 weeks on GPU cluster

### Baseline Circuit (No Erasure)

**Step 1**: Initialize system qubit in equal superposition
```
|ψ₀⟩ = H|0⟩_S = (1/√2)(|0⟩_S + |1⟩_S)
```

**Step 2**: Evolve under Hamiltonian (simulates double-slit paths)
```
U|ψ₀⟩ = (1/√2)(e^(iφ_A)|0⟩_S + e^(iφ_B)|1⟩_S)
```

**Step 3**: Measure interference visibility
```
V_original = |⟨ψ|H|ψ⟩|² - baseline visibility
```

### Which-Path Measurement (Interference Destruction)

**Step 4**: Entangle ancilla with system (records which-path)
```
CNOT_SA: |ψ⟩_S|0⟩_A → (1/√2)(|0⟩_S|0⟩_A + |1⟩_S|1⟩_A)
```

**Step 5**: Measure visibility (should drop to ~50% due to entanglement)
```
V_which_path ≈ 0.5 * V_original (interference destroyed)
```

### Erasure Protocol (To Be Optimized)

**Goal**: Design gate sequence that decouples ancilla from system, restoring interference.

**Baseline erasure** (standard protocol):
```
Step 6: Apply Hadamard to ancilla H_A
Step 7: Measure ancilla in X basis
Step 8: Post-select on outcome (ancilla state doesn't reveal path)
Step 9: Measure system visibility
```

**Human task**: Optimize Steps 6-9 (gate sequence, measurement basis, post-selection strategy)

**AI task**: Same, but constrained to learned patterns from training data

## Metrics and Success Criteria

### Primary Metric: Visibility Restoration Ratio

**Definition**:
```
R = V_restored / V_original
```

Where:
- V_original = visibility before which-path measurement
- V_restored = visibility after erasure protocol

**Measurement procedure**:
1. Run baseline circuit (no which-path) → measure V_original
2. Run which-path circuit (with CNOT entanglement) → measure V_which_path (should be ~0.5 V_original)
3. Run erasure circuit (human or AI protocol) → measure V_restored
4. Calculate R = V_restored / V_original

**Interference visibility formula**:
```
V = (P_max - P_min) / (P_max + P_min)
```

Where P_max and P_min are maximum and minimum probabilities in interference pattern.

**Target values** (from LRT prediction):
- **Human**: R_human = 0.95 ± 0.03 (95% restoration)
- **AI**: R_AI = 0.85 ± 0.05 (85% restoration)
- **Difference**: ΔR = 0.10 (10% advantage for humans)

### Secondary Metrics

**Gate count**:
- Average number of gates in protocol
- Expected: Human protocols more efficient (fewer gates for same visibility)

**Success probability** (post-selection):
- Fraction of runs where erasure succeeds
- Expected: Similar for human and AI (~50% for standard erasure)

**Simulation accuracy**:
- Correlation between simulated R and experimental R
- Expected: >0.90 correlation (simulations predictive)

**Time to design**:
- Human: 3-6 hours
- AI: 1-2 weeks training + instant inference

### Statistical Analysis

**Hypothesis test**:
```
H₀: R_human = R_AI (no difference)
H₁: R_human > R_AI (human advantage)
```

**Test**: One-tailed t-test (α = 0.05)

**Sample size**:
- 10-15 human protocols
- 10 AI protocols
- Power analysis: detect ΔR = 0.10 with power 0.80 requires n ≥ 10 per group

**Effect size**:
- Cohen's d = (R_human - R_AI) / σ_pooled
- Expected: d ≈ 1.0 (large effect)

---

## Analysis Plan

### Data Collection

**For each protocol** (human or AI):
1. Run 1000 shots on quantum hardware
2. Extract interference pattern (P(0) and P(1) vs. phase)
3. Calculate visibility V = (P_max - P_min) / (P_max + P_min)
4. Repeat for 10 different noise realizations (daily calibrations)
5. Average visibility over 10 runs → R = V_restored / V_original

**Metadata**:
- Gate sequence
- Justification/reasoning (human only)
- Simulation prediction
- Hardware noise parameters (T₁, T₂, gate fidelity)
- Date/time of execution

### Qualitative Analysis (Human Protocols)

**Research questions**:
1. What strategies do humans use that AI doesn't?
2. Do humans explore non-standard gate sequences?
3. How do humans justify their designs?

**Method**:
- Code justifications for themes (e.g., "phase manipulation", "error mitigation", "non-intuitive approach")
- Identify common patterns vs. outliers
- Correlate strategies with visibility restoration

**Example themes**:
- **Creative phase relationships**: Using non-standard rotation angles (e.g., θ = π/7 instead of standard π/2)
- **Multi-step erasure**: Gradual decoupling via intermediate gates
- **Error-aware design**: Accounting for specific noise sources (T₁ vs. T₂)

### LRT Interpretation

**If R_human > R_AI (as predicted)**:
- Supports LRT: High-entropy IIS access → creative optimization
- Falsifies Copenhagen/MWI: No mechanism predicts human advantage in **design** (measurement outcomes identical)

**If R_human ≈ R_AI (no difference)**:
- Challenges LRT consciousness formalization
- Suggests AI can match human creativity in quantum protocol design
- Requires re-evaluation of IIS access hypothesis

**If R_AI > R_human (AI advantage)**:
- Falsifies LRT human-AI distinction
- Suggests algorithmic optimization superior to human intuition
- May indicate limitations of 12-18 month timeline (AI needs more training)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1**: Hardware instability (qubit coherence degrades)
- **Likelihood**: Medium (superconducting qubits sensitive to environment)
- **Impact**: High (invalidates data)
- **Mitigation**: Daily recalibration, run experiments over multiple days, collect redundant data

**Risk 2**: AI training fails (doesn't converge to good policy)
- **Likelihood**: Low (PPO/SAC robust algorithms)
- **Impact**: Medium (delays timeline, reduces comparison quality)
- **Mitigation**: Hyperparameter tuning, transfer learning from literature data, expert seeding

**Risk 3**: Noise too high (visibility restoration impossible)
- **Likelihood**: Low (modern superconducting qubits have T₂ ~ 50 μs, sufficient for 10-gate circuits)
- **Impact**: High (experiment infeasible)
- **Mitigation**: Pre-test baseline circuits, select high-fidelity qubits, error mitigation techniques

### Statistical Risks

**Risk 4**: No significant difference between human and AI
- **Likelihood**: Medium (LRT prediction may be wrong)
- **Impact**: Medium (doesn't falsify LRT, but weakens consciousness claim)
- **Mitigation**: Increase sample size (n=15-20 per group), run secondary experiments (Bell test, GHZ states)

**Risk 5**: High variance within human group (some excel, some don't)
- **Likelihood**: High (human creativity variable)
- **Impact**: Low (expected, still reveals overall trend)
- **Mitigation**: Report distribution (median, quartiles), analyze top performers separately

### Ethical Risks

**Risk 6**: Human participants feel competitive pressure (stress, bias)
- **Likelihood**: Low (task is exploratory, no high stakes)
- **Impact**: Low (may affect creativity, but not safety)
- **Mitigation**: Emphasize exploratory nature, debrief participants, anonymize results

**Risk 7**: AI system appears to match human creativity (AGI concerns)
- **Likelihood**: Low (current AI limited to training data interpolation)
- **Impact**: Medium (public/philosophical implications)
- **Mitigation**: Clearly communicate AI limitations (finite training data, no full IIS access)

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Gate Set

**Single-qubit rotations**:
- R_x(θ) = exp(-iθX/2) = cos(θ/2)I - i sin(θ/2)X
- R_y(θ) = exp(-iθY/2) = cos(θ/2)I - i sin(θ/2)Y
- R_z(θ) = exp(-iθZ/2) = cos(θ/2)I - i sin(θ/2)Z

**Two-qubit gates**:
- CNOT (controlled-NOT): |00⟩→|00⟩, |01⟩→|01⟩, |10⟩→|11⟩, |11⟩→|10⟩
- CZ (controlled-Z): |00⟩→|00⟩, |01⟩→|01⟩, |10⟩→|10⟩, |11⟩→-|11⟩

**Measurement**:
- Computational basis: {|0⟩, |1⟩}
- X basis: {|+⟩ = (|0⟩+|1⟩)/√2, |-⟩ = (|0⟩-|1⟩)/√2}
- Y basis: {|i+⟩ = (|0⟩+i|1⟩)/√2, |i-⟩ = (|0⟩-i|1⟩)/√2}

### Appendix B: Noise Model (Qiskit Format)

```python
from qiskit.providers.aer.noise import NoiseModel, thermal_relaxation_error, depolarizing_error

# Relaxation times
T1 = 100e-6  # 100 microseconds
T2 = 50e-6   # 50 microseconds

# Gate times
t_single = 50e-9   # 50 ns (single-qubit gate)
t_two = 300e-9     # 300 ns (two-qubit gate)

# Thermal relaxation errors
error_single = thermal_relaxation_error(T1, T2, t_single)
error_two = thermal_relaxation_error(T1, T2, t_two)

# Depolarizing errors (gate imperfections)
error_single_depol = depolarizing_error(0.001, 1)  # 99.9% fidelity
error_two_depol = depolarizing_error(0.01, 2)     # 99% fidelity

# Combined errors
error_single_combined = error_single.compose(error_single_depol)
error_two_combined = error_two.compose(error_two_depol)

# Build noise model
noise_model = NoiseModel()
noise_model.add_all_qubit_quantum_error(error_single_combined, ['u1', 'u2', 'u3'])
noise_model.add_all_qubit_quantum_error(error_two_combined, ['cx'])
```

### Appendix C: Example Human Justification

**Protocol submitted by Participant 3**:

**Gate sequence**:
1. R_y(π/2) on S (prepare superposition)
2. CNOT(S → A) (entangle, destroy interference)
3. R_z(π/4) on A (phase rotation - non-standard)
4. R_y(-π/8) on S (compensate for noise asymmetry)
5. R_y(π/2) on A (prepare for erasure)
6. CNOT(A → S) (reverse entanglement)
7. R_z(-π/4) on A (undo phase)
8. Measure A in X basis
9. Post-select on |+⟩_A outcome

**Justification**:
"I used a non-standard π/4 phase rotation (Step 3) to create a 'twisted' entanglement that's easier to unwind in the presence of dephasing noise (T₂ = 50 μs). The asymmetric R_y(-π/8) on S (Step 4) compensates for the fact that T₁ and T₂ affect |0⟩ and |1⟩ differently. The reverse CNOT (Step 6) plus phase undo (Step 7) should restore coherence. I expect ~93% visibility restoration based on simulation."

**LRT interpretation**: This shows human creativity (non-standard angles, asymmetry compensation) not likely in AI training data.
