**Status**: Unsolved - Preliminary Progress Only

The emergence of continuous Lorentz invariance SO(3,1) from discrete permutation group S_4 remains the most significant open challenge. While Sections 2-4 rigorously derive quantum amplitudes and Born rule, spacetime symmetry requires assumptions we cannot yet justify. We present concrete preliminary work and clearly state limitations.

## The Challenge

**Fundamental tension**: S_4 is finite (24 elements), discrete. SO(3,1) is continuous, infinite-dimensional Lie group.

**Question**: How can continuous symmetry emerge from discrete structure?

This parallels problems in lattice QCD (discrete → continuous), spin networks (discrete → smooth spacetime), and causal sets (discrete events → manifolds). But for S_4 → SO(3,1), the mechanism remains unclear.

## Key Observation: Binary Tetrahedral Group

**Theorem** [Conway & Smith 2003]: Finite subgroups of Spin(1,3) include the **binary tetrahedral group 2T ≅ SL(2,3)** with exactly **24 elements** = |S_4|.

While S_4 ≇ 2T, they are closely related (homomorphism S_4 → 2T/Z_2 ≅ A_4 exists). This suggests **N=4 may be special** for Lorentz structure—potentially explaining why N=4 is preferred for spacetime, though this remains conjectural.

## Preliminary Construction

**Discrete symmetries**: Graph automorphisms of permutohedron Π_3 preserve adjacency structure. Conjugation maps φ_g(σ) = gσg^{-1} form a group of discrete transformations.

**Limitation**: These are algebraically well-defined but lack clear physical interpretation as velocity boosts (which require continuous parameter β ∈ (-1,1)).

## Open Problems

**Four major unsolved questions**:

1. **Pseudo-Riemannian metric**: Standard Kendall tau metric d(σ,τ) = h(στ^{-1}) is Euclidean (positive-definite). Need Lorentzian signature (+,-,-,-). No natural construction found.

2. **Velocity parameter**: Relate discrete automorphisms to continuous boost rapidity θ ∈ ℝ. Discrete set (24 elements) vs. continuous parameter gap remains.

3. **Continuum limit**: Rigorously prove S_N algebra approaches Lorentz algebra as N→∞. Currently speculative hypothesis with no proof.

4. **N=4 uniqueness**: Justify N=4 specifically (vs. N=3,5,...). Partial progress via 2T connection (24 elements), but not proof.

## Alternative: Fundamental Discreteness

**Radical option**: Accept spacetime is fundamentally discrete at Planck scale [Rovelli 2004; Bombelli et al. 1987]. Lorentz invariance emerges as macroscopic approximation, analogous to thermodynamics from statistical mechanics.

**Precedents**: Loop quantum gravity, causal sets, string theory all feature Planck-scale discreteness.

**Implication**: S_4 is fundamental discrete symmetry; continuous Lorentz is effective low-energy description.

## Honest Assessment

This is the **weakest part of the framework**. Spacetime emergence remains **conjectural**. In contrast to rigorous quantum derivations (Sections 2-4), Lorentz invariance lacks first-principles explanation.

**Two paths forward**:
1. **Derivation**: Solve continuum limit (high-risk, years of research)
2. **Discrete acceptance**: Fundamental Planck-scale discreteness (requires emergence mechanism)

Both remain open research directions.
