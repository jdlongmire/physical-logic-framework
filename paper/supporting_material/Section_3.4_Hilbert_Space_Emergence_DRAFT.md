# Section 3.4: Hilbert Space Emergence

## Introduction

Standard quantum mechanics begins by postulating a Hilbert space ℋ with inner product structure and orthonormal basis states. In our framework, we derive these structures from the combinatorial properties of logically valid permutations. This section demonstrates how the mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics—Hilbert spaces, superposition, and measurement—emerges naturally from the valid state space V_K.

## Construction of the State Space

**Definition 3.4.1** (Emergent Hilbert Space): For a system with N distinguishable elements and constraint threshold K = N-2, define the finite-dimensional Hilbert space:

ℋ_N := span_ℂ {|σ⟩ : σ ∈ V_K}

where V_K = {σ ∈ S_N : h(σ) ≤ K} is the valid state space and {|σ⟩} denotes an abstract orthonormal basis indexed by permutations.

**Dimension**: dim(ℋ_N) = |V_K|

For our validated cases:
- N=3: dim(ℋ_3) = 3 (qutrit-like system)
- N=4: dim(ℋ_4) = 9 (9-dimensional system)
- N=5: dim(ℋ_5) = 29
- N=7: dim(ℋ_7) = 343 = 7³

## Inner Product Structure

**Definition 3.4.2** (Inner Product): The inner product on ℋ_N is defined by declaring the basis {|σ⟩} to be orthonormal:

⟨σ|σ'⟩ := δ_{σσ'} = { 1 if σ = σ', 0 otherwise }

Extended by linearity to all vectors:

⟨ψ|φ⟩ = ⟨Σ_σ a_σ |σ⟩ | Σ_{σ'} b_{σ'} |σ'⟩⟩ = Σ_σ a_σ* b_σ

where a_σ* denotes complex conjugation.

**Justification - Quantum Distinguishability**:

The orthogonality ⟨σ|σ'⟩ = 0 for σ ≠ σ' reflects a fundamental principle: valid permutations are **completely distinguishable** configurations of the information space. In quantum information theory, perfectly distinguishable states must be orthogonal (Holevo's theorem). Since each σ ∈ V_K represents a distinct labeling satisfying the logical constraints, they correspond to mutually exclusive, perfectly discriminable states—hence orthogonal.

This is analogous to position eigenstates |x⟩ in standard QM: different positions are perfectly distinguishable, leading to ⟨x|x'⟩ = δ(x-x').

## General State Vectors

**Definition 3.4.3** (Pure States): A general pure state in ℋ_N is a normalized superposition:

|ψ⟩ = Σ_{σ ∈ V_K} a_σ |σ⟩

subject to normalization ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 1:

Σ_{σ ∈ V_K} |a_σ|² = 1

The complex amplitudes a_σ ∈ ℂ encode both magnitude and phase:

a_σ = |a_σ| e^{iφ_σ}

**Born Rule (Recovered)**: For a state |ψ⟩ = Σ_σ a_σ|σ⟩, the probability of measuring the system in configuration σ is:

P(σ) = |⟨σ|ψ⟩|² = |a_σ|²

This is the standard Born rule, now derived from the inner product structure.

## Maximum Entropy State

From Section 3.2, the maximum entropy principle selects the uniform distribution over V_K:

P(σ) = 1/|V_K| for all σ ∈ V_K

In the Hilbert space formulation, this corresponds to the **equal superposition state**:

|ψ_MaxEnt⟩ = (1/√|V_K|) Σ_{σ ∈ V_K} |σ⟩

**Verification**:

P(σ) = |⟨σ|ψ_MaxEnt⟩|² = |(1/√|V_K|)|² = 1/|V_K| ✓

**Phase freedom**: More generally, any state of the form:

|ψ_MaxEnt^{φ}⟩ = (1/√|V_K|) Σ_{σ ∈ V_K} e^{iφ_σ} |σ⟩

yields the same Born rule probabilities P(σ) = 1/|V_K|, since:

|⟨σ|ψ_MaxEnt^{φ}⟩|² = |(1/√|V_K|) e^{iφ_σ}|² = 1/|V_K|

The phases {φ_σ} represent **gauge degrees of freedom** that do not affect single-state measurement probabilities but become crucial for interference phenomena (Section 3.5).

## Observable Operators

**Definition 3.4.4** (Observable): An observable is a Hermitian operator A: ℋ_N → ℋ_N satisfying A† = A.

**Natural observables** from permutation structure:

1. **Inversion count operator**:

   Ĥ |σ⟩ := h(σ) |σ⟩

   Eigenvalues: {h(σ) : σ ∈ V_K} ⊆ {0, 1, ..., K}

2. **Permutation position operators**:

   X̂_i |σ⟩ := σ(i) |σ⟩

   Measures the value at position i in permutation σ

3. **Graph Laplacian** (for dynamics):

   L̂ = D - A

   where A is the adjacency matrix of the Cayley graph on V_K and D is the degree matrix

**Expectation values**: For state |ψ⟩ and observable A:

⟨A⟩_ψ = ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩ = Σ_{σ,σ'} a_σ* a_{σ'} ⟨σ|A|σ'⟩

For diagonal observables (like Ĥ):

⟨Ĥ⟩_ψ = Σ_σ |a_σ|² h(σ)

For the MaxEnt state:

⟨Ĥ⟩_MaxEnt = (1/|V_K|) Σ_σ h(σ)

This is the average inversion count over the valid state space.

## Density Matrix Formulation

**Definition 3.4.5** (Density Operator): For pure state |ψ⟩, the density operator is:

ρ̂ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| = Σ_{σ,σ'} a_σ a_{σ'}* |σ⟩⟨σ'|

**Matrix elements**: ρ_{σσ'} = a_σ a_{σ'}*

**Properties**:
- Hermitian: ρ† = ρ
- Positive: ⟨φ|ρ|φ⟩ ≥ 0 for all |φ⟩
- Unit trace: Tr(ρ) = Σ_σ ρ_{σσ} = Σ_σ |a_σ|² = 1
- Idempotent (pure state): ρ² = ρ

**MaxEnt density matrix**:

ρ_MaxEnt = (1/|V_K|) Σ_{σ,σ'} |σ⟩⟨σ'| = (1/|V_K|) 𝕀_{V_K}

where 𝕀_{V_K} is the identity operator on span{|σ⟩ : σ ∈ V_K}.

**Born rule via density matrix**: P(σ) = ⟨σ|ρ|σ⟩ = ρ_{σσ}

For MaxEnt: P(σ) = 1/|V_K| ✓

## Connection to Standard Quantum Mechanics

The structure we have derived—finite-dimensional Hilbert space, orthonormal basis, inner product, observables, Born rule—is **identical** to the mathematical framework of standard quantum mechanics for finite-dimensional systems.

**Key differences**:

| Standard QM | LFT Framework |
|-------------|---------------|
| Hilbert space postulated | Hilbert space derived from V_K |
| Basis states physical assumption | Basis states = valid permutations |
| Dimension arbitrary | Dimension = \|V_K\| (determined by K=N-2) |
| Born rule postulated | Born rule from MaxEnt principle |
| Inner product assumed | Orthogonality from distinguishability |

**What remains to derive**:
- Superposition principle justification (Section 3.5)
- Dynamics (Hamiltonian, Schrödinger equation)
- Measurement postulate (collapse vs. decoherence)
- Entanglement and tensor product structure (multi-system extension)

## Worked Example: N=3 System

For N=3 with K=1, the valid state space is:

V_1 = {(0,1,2), (1,0,2), (0,2,1)}

(Using 0-indexing for permutations)

**Hilbert space**: ℋ_3 = ℂ³ with basis:

{|012⟩, |102⟩, |021⟩}

**MaxEnt state**:

|ψ_MaxEnt⟩ = (1/√3)(|012⟩ + |102⟩ + |021⟩)

**Born rule**: P(012) = P(102) = P(021) = 1/3 ✓

**Inversion operator eigenvalues**:
- h(012) = 0 (identity)
- h(102) = 1 (one swap)
- h(021) = 1 (one swap)

**Average inversions**: ⟨Ĥ⟩ = (0 + 1 + 1)/3 = 2/3

This 3-level system behaves analogously to a qutrit in quantum computing, with the constraint K=1 selecting three specific basis states from the full S_3 = 6-element permutation group.

## Summary

We have demonstrated that the full mathematical structure of quantum mechanics—Hilbert space, inner product, superposition, observables, and Born rule—emerges from the logical constraint structure on permutation space. The key insight is that **distinguishability implies orthogonality**, and **maximum entropy implies equal amplitude superposition**.

This derivation reduces the "quantum postulates" from assumptions to mathematical consequences of information-theoretic principles applied to discrete combinatorial structures. The next section (3.5) will show how quantum interference arises from the phase degrees of freedom in superpositions.
