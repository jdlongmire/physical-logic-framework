## Natural Representation Theorem

The mapping from logical operators (ID, NC, EM) to permutations with inversion count is not arbitrary but the **canonical categorical representation** of totally ordered structures. We demonstrate this via five independent mathematical criteria.

### Logical Structure

The three logical operators define a specific structure:

**Identity (ID)**: Establishes reference total ordering 1 < 2 < ... < N
**Non-Contradiction (NC)**: Requires bijection (each outcome has unique position)
**Excluded Middle (EM)**: Requires totality (every pair must be ordered)

Combined: ID + NC + EM specify a **totally ordered set** on N elements with fixed reference.

### Category-Theoretic Foundation

**Fundamental Theorem**: Any finite totally ordered set of N elements is uniquely isomorphic to ([N], ≤) where [N] = {1,2,...,N}.

**Proof**: Label elements by rank. This defines unique order-preserving bijection. □

The space of all total orderings on N elements corresponds bijectively to S_N: each ordering determines a unique permutation σ(i) = rank of element i.

**Theorem 2.2.1** (Natural Representation): The space of logical configurations under (ID, NC, EM) is canonically isomorphic to the symmetric group S_N.

This is the **standard categorical construction**, not arbitrary choice.

### Inversion Count: Five Independent Justifications

The inversion count h(σ) = |{(i,j) : i<j and σ(i)>σ(j)}| emerges as the unique metric satisfying:

| Criterion | Framework | Interpretation |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **1. Logic** | Direct | h(σ) = # of EM violations (pairs violating reference order) |
| **2. Statistics** | Kendall tau | h(σ) = standard rank correlation distance [Kendall 1938] |
| **3. Computation** | Sorting | h(σ) = bubble sort complexity (minimal adjacent swaps) |
| **4. Information** | Complexity | h(σ) ∝ minimum description length (bits to specify σ) |
| **5. Algebra** | Coxeter | h(σ) = word length in A_{N-1} (Section 4.5.2) |

**All five criteria converge on inversion count**—multiply-determined necessity.

### Most Fundamental Justification

**Direct from logic**: An inversion is a pair (i,j) with i < j but σ(i) > σ(j), violating the reference ordering established by ID. Therefore:

```
h(σ) = number of EM constraint violations
```

This is the **primary definition**. All other interpretations (Kendall tau, sorting complexity, etc.) follow as mathematical consequences.

### Uniqueness: Alternative Metrics Fail

Four alternative permutation metrics fail multiple criteria (Section 2.6 for full analysis):

- **Hamming distance** d_H(σ) = |{i : σ(i) ≠ i}|: Counts position mismatches, not pairwise violations ✗
- **Cayley distance**: Uses arbitrary transpositions (not adjacent), breaks Coxeter connection ✗
- **Ulam distance**: Indirect (LIS-based), no logical interpretation ✗
- **Levenshtein**: Not applicable to fixed-length permutations ✗

**Only inversion count** satisfies all five criteria + exhibits K=N-2 properties (Section 4.5).

### Worked Example: N=3

| Ordering | Permutation σ | h(σ) | EM violations |
|----------|---------------|------|---------------|
| 1 < 2 < 3 | (1,2,3) | 0 | none |
| 1 < 3 < 2 | (1,3,2) | 1 | (2,3) |
| 2 < 1 < 3 | (2,1,3) | 1 | (1,2) |
| 2 < 3 < 1 | (2,3,1) | 2 | (1,2), (1,3) |
| 3 < 1 < 2 | (3,1,2) | 2 | (1,3), (2,3) |
| 3 < 2 < 1 | (3,2,1) | 3 | all pairs |

**Verification**: Inversion count exactly equals pairwise ordering disagreements. For K=1=N-2, valid states V_1 = {(1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3)} differ from reference by ≤1 pairwise disagreement.

## Conclusion

Permutations with inversion count are **multiply-determined** by:
1. Category theory (natural representation of total orderings)
2. Logic (direct EM violation counting)
3. Statistics (standard Kendall tau metric)
4. Computation (bubble sort complexity)
5. Information (minimum description length)
6. Algebra (Coxeter group word length)

**Theorem 2.2.1** establishes this as canonical, not ad-hoc. Combined with K=N-2 derivation (Section 4.5), the framework emerges necessarily from logical structure.
