# Section 3.5: Superposition and Interference

## Introduction

In Section 3.4, we derived the Hilbert space structure and showed that the MaxEnt principle selects equal-amplitude superpositions |ψ⟩ = (1/√|V_K|) Σ_σ e^{iφ_σ}|σ⟩. However, the phases {φ_σ} remained undetermined—they do not affect the Born rule probabilities P(σ) = |⟨σ|ψ⟩|² = 1/|V_K|.

This section addresses a critical question: **what physical role do these phases play?** We show that phase relationships between amplitudes give rise to quantum interference, the hallmark phenomenon distinguishing quantum from classical probability theory. Furthermore, we propose a connection between phase evolution and the L-flow dynamics on the permutation graph.

## Superposition Principle

**Principle 3.5.1** (Superposition): Any normalized linear combination of valid states represents a physically realizable state:

|ψ⟩ = Σ_{σ ∈ V_K} a_σ |σ⟩,    Σ_σ |a_σ|² = 1

**Justification**: Unlike classical probability distributions (which must have non-negative weights), quantum amplitudes a_σ ∈ ℂ can be complex. This allows for **coherent superposition** where phases encode relative relationships between configurations.

**Information-theoretic interpretation**: A classical observer limited to local measurements cannot distinguish between:
1. Mixed state: ρ_mixed = Σ_σ p_σ |σ⟩⟨σ| (incoherent mixture)
2. Pure superposition: |ψ⟩ = Σ_σ √p_σ e^{iφ_σ}|σ⟩ (coherent superposition)

if they only measure σ-basis projections. However, measurements in other bases (e.g., superposition bases) reveal the phase relationships, breaking the degeneracy. This is the essence of **quantum contextuality** [Spekkens 2005].

## Two-Path Interference: N=3 Example

Consider the N=3 system with V_1 = {|012⟩, |102⟩, |021⟩}. Prepare a superposition of two states:

|ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(|012⟩ + e^{iφ}|102⟩)

**Born rule probabilities**:
- P(012) = |⟨012|ψ⟩|² = 1/2
- P(102) = |⟨102|ψ⟩|² = 1/2
- P(021) = |⟨021|ψ⟩|² = 0

**Alternative measurement basis**: Define superposition states:

|+⟩ = (1/√2)(|012⟩ + |102⟩)
|−⟩ = (1/√2)(|012⟩ − |102⟩)

**Measurement in {|+⟩, |−⟩} basis**:

P(+) = |⟨+|ψ⟩|² = |(1/√2)(⟨012| + ⟨102|)(1/√2)(|012⟩ + e^{iφ}|102⟩)|²
     = |(1/2)(1 + e^{iφ})|²
     = (1/4)|1 + e^{iφ}|²
     = (1/4)(1 + e^{iφ})(1 + e^{-iφ})
     = (1/4)(2 + 2cos φ)
     = **(1/2)(1 + cos φ)**

P(−) = |⟨−|ψ⟩|² = (1/2)(1 − cos φ)

**Interference pattern**: The probability oscillates with phase φ:
- φ = 0: P(+) = 1, P(−) = 0 (constructive interference)
- φ = π: P(+) = 0, P(−) = 1 (destructive interference)
- φ = π/2: P(+) = P(−) = 1/2 (no interference)

This is **pure quantum interference**—impossible in classical probability theory where P(+) would be constant regardless of "phase."

## General Interference Formula

For a general superposition |ψ⟩ = Σ_σ a_σ|σ⟩, measurement in an arbitrary basis {|k⟩} yields:

P(k) = |⟨k|ψ⟩|² = |Σ_σ a_σ⟨k|σ⟩|²

Expanding:

P(k) = (Σ_σ a_σ⟨k|σ⟩)(Σ_{σ'} a_{σ'}*⟨k|σ'⟩)*
     = Σ_{σ,σ'} a_σ a_{σ'}* ⟨k|σ⟩⟨σ'|k⟩

Separating diagonal (σ=σ') and off-diagonal (σ≠σ') terms:

P(k) = Σ_σ |a_σ|² |⟨k|σ⟩|² + Σ_{σ≠σ'} a_σ a_{σ'}* ⟨k|σ⟩⟨σ'|k⟩

The first term is the **classical probability** (weighted sum of squared overlaps). The second term is the **quantum interference** contribution, containing cross terms that depend on phase relationships.

**Key insight**: Interference arises from the **off-diagonal elements** of the density matrix ρ_{σσ'} = a_σ a_{σ'}* for σ ≠ σ'. These coherences encode relative phases and vanish for mixed (incoherent) states.

## Double-Slit Analog in LFT

**Physical setup**: Consider a "permutation double-slit" experiment where:
- Source: Prepares equal superposition |ψ_s⟩ = (1/√|V_K|) Σ_σ |σ⟩
- "Slits": Two specific permutations σ_1, σ_2 ∈ V_K (e.g., for N=3: σ_1 = |012⟩, σ_2 = |102⟩)
- Filters: Project onto two-state subspace |ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(|σ_1⟩ + e^{iφ}|σ_2⟩)
- Detection: Measurement in superposition basis

**Classical prediction** (particle model): If the system randomly chooses σ_1 or σ_2 with equal probability, then P(outcome) = (P(outcome|σ_1) + P(outcome|σ_2))/2 (no φ dependence).

**Quantum prediction** (wave model): P(outcome) exhibits interference pattern ~ (1 + cos φ) as shown above.

**LFT interpretation**: The permutations σ_1 and σ_2 represent distinct "information paths" through the logical constraint structure. When both paths are coherent (unknown which was taken), they interfere. If we measure which path was taken (e.g., measure inversion count Ĥ distinguishing h(σ_1) from h(σ_2)), coherence is destroyed and interference disappears.

**Connection to which-path information**:
- Coherent superposition: ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| has off-diagonal elements ρ_{12} ≠ 0 → interference
- Incoherent mixture: ρ = (1/2)|σ_1⟩⟨σ_1| + (1/2)|σ_2⟩⟨σ_2| has ρ_{12} = 0 → no interference

This recovers the complementarity principle: **path knowledge destroys interference** [Bohr 1928, Scully & Drühl 1982].

## Phase Evolution and L-Flow

**Open question**: How do phases {φ_σ} evolve in time?

In standard quantum mechanics, phase evolution is governed by the Schrödinger equation:

iℏ ∂_t |ψ⟩ = Ĥ |ψ⟩

For energy eigenstates Ĥ|n⟩ = E_n|n⟩, phases evolve as:

φ_n(t) = φ_n(0) − (E_n/ℏ)t

**LFT proposal** (speculative): The graph Laplacian L̂ on the Cayley graph of V_K plays the role of a Hamiltonian:

Ĥ_LFT := L̂ = D − A

where:
- A_{σσ'} = 1 if σ, σ' differ by one adjacent transposition (edge in Cayley graph)
- D_{σσ} = degree of node σ (number of neighbors)

**Eigenvalue equation**: L̂|ψ_k⟩ = λ_k|ψ_k⟩

The eigenvalues {λ_k} correspond to "energy levels" of the permutation configuration space. Smaller λ_k corresponds to "smoother" distributions over V_K (fewer violations of neighbor constraints).

**Dynamics**: If |ψ(0)⟩ = Σ_k c_k|ψ_k⟩, then:

|ψ(t)⟩ = Σ_k c_k e^{−iλ_k t/ℏ} |ψ_k⟩

**Connection to L-flow**: Recall (Section 2.4) that L-flow describes monotonic decrease in inversion count h(σ) over time. This suggests:

- **Unitary evolution**: Phase evolution via graph Laplacian (reversible, preserves |V_K|)
- **Dissipative component**: Inversion reduction via constraint satisfaction (irreversible, arrow of time)

**Proposed dual dynamics**:

∂_t |ψ⟩ = −(i/ℏ)L̂|ψ⟩ − Γ Ĥ|ψ⟩

where:
- L̂ term: Unitary (phase) evolution preserving norm
- Ĥ term: Non-unitary dissipation reducing inversion count
- Γ: Damping rate (related to logical filtering strength)

This is analogous to Lindblad master equations in open quantum systems [Breuer & Petruccione 2002].

**Challenge**: Reconciling unitary QM with irreversible L-flow remains an open problem. Possible resolutions:
1. **Emergent arrow**: Unitary dynamics at fundamental level, effective irreversibility from coarse-graining
2. **Measurement-driven collapse**: L-flow represents continuous measurement of h(σ)
3. **Decoherence**: Coupling to "environment" (permutations outside V_K) destroys coherence

## Entanglement and Multi-System Extension

**Extension to N_1 + N_2 systems**: For two subsystems with state spaces V_{K_1} and V_{K_2}, the joint Hilbert space is:

ℋ_{12} = ℋ_{N_1} ⊗ ℋ_{N_2} = span{|σ_1⟩ ⊗ |σ_2⟩ : σ_1 ∈ V_{K_1}, σ_2 ∈ V_{K_2}}

Dimension: dim(ℋ_{12}) = |V_{K_1}| × |V_{K_2}|

**Entangled states**: Not all states factorize. Example (N_1 = N_2 = 3):

|ψ_entangled⟩ = (1/√2)(|012⟩_1 ⊗ |012⟩_2 + |102⟩_1 ⊗ |102⟩_2)

This cannot be written as |ψ_1⟩ ⊗ |ψ_2⟩.

**Measurement correlations**: If we measure subsystem 1 in configuration σ_1, subsystem 2 collapses to σ_2 (nonlocal correlation).

**Bell inequality violations**: Entangled LFT states should violate Bell's CHSH inequality [Bell 1964, Clauser et al. 1969] just as standard QM states do, since the mathematical structure is identical.

**LFT interpretation**: Entanglement arises from correlations in logical constraint satisfaction across subsystems. If V_K enforces global constraints coupling N_1 and N_2, the states cannot be factorized.

## Summary

We have shown that:

1. **Superposition** is the fundamental structure allowing complex amplitudes a_σ ∈ ℂ
2. **Interference** emerges from off-diagonal density matrix elements ρ_{σσ'} ≠ 0
3. **Phase relationships** {φ_σ} encode which-path information and coherence
4. **Double-slit analog** in N=3 system exhibits standard quantum interference pattern
5. **Graph Laplacian dynamics** (speculative) may govern phase evolution
6. **L-flow** introduces irreversibility, requiring reconciliation with unitary QM

The quantum phenomena of interference, coherence, and complementarity are **not assumed** but rather **emerge** from the Hilbert space structure derived in Section 3.4 combined with complex-valued amplitudes allowed by superposition.

**Remaining challenges**:
- Derive (rather than postulate) Schrödinger equation from LFT
- Explain measurement collapse (or decoherence) from L-flow
- Formalize entanglement in multi-system LFT
- Connect graph Laplacian eigenvalues to physical observables
