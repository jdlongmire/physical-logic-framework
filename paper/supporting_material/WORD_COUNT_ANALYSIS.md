## Trimming Strategy

### Approach: Focus on Core Contributions

**Keep Maximum Detail** (our unique contributions):
- Section 4.5: K(N) triple proof (BREAKTHROUGH) - keep ~5,000 words
- Section 2.2 + 2.6: Logic justification (addresses major criticism) - keep ~3,000 words
- Section 3.4 + 3.5: Quantum structure (addresses major criticism) - keep ~1,000 words

**Moderate Detail** (important but standard):
- Section 3: Born Rule derivation - trim to ~1,500 words
- Section 4: Validation - trim to ~1,000 words
- Section 2: Framework (excluding 2.2, 2.6) - trim to ~800 words

**Minimal Detail** (context only):
- Section 1: Introduction - trim to ~1,000 words
- Section 5: Lean verification - trim to ~500 words
- Section 6: Discussion (excluding 6.3.1) - trim to ~1,000 words
- Section 6.3.1: Lorentz toy model - trim to ~2,000 words
- Section 7: Conclusion - trim to ~500 words

**Total Target Distribution** (~8,500 words):
- Abstract: 200 words
- Section 1: 1,000 words
- Section 2: 3,800 words (800 base + 2,000 for 2.2 + 1,000 for 2.6)
- Section 3: 2,500 words (1,500 base + 500 for 3.4 + 500 for 3.5)
- Section 4: 6,000 words (1,000 base + 5,000 for 4.5)
- Section 5: 500 words (minimal Lean verification)
- Section 6: 3,000 words (1,000 base + 2,000 for 6.3.1)
- Section 7: 500 words
- **Total**: ~17,500 words → **still need to cut ~9,000 more**

## Revised Strategy: Aggressive Focus

Given the massive word count, we need to be **extremely selective**.

### Option A: Separate Papers (RECOMMENDED)

**Paper 1: "Quantum Amplitudes from Logical Constraints"** (~8,500 words)
- Focus: K(N) derivation + Born rule + validation
- Sections: Abstract, Intro (short), Framework (focused), K(N) triple proof, Born rule, Validation, Conclusion
- Omit: Lean verification (appendix), Lorentz (future work), Hilbert space details (brief mention)

**Paper 2: "Logic to Permutation: Foundational Justification"** (~6,000 words)
- Focus: Category theory, alternative metrics, natural representation
- Sections: Intro, Section 2.2, Section 2.6, Worked examples
- Status: Technical follow-up

**Paper 3: "Spacetime Emergence from Permutation Geometry"** (future)
- Focus: Lorentz toy model, N=4 justification, continuum limit
- Status: When Lorentz problem is solved

### Option B: Ruthless Trimming (Single Paper)

**Target Allocation** (~8,500 words):
- Abstract: 200 words
- Section 1 (Introduction): 800 words (cut 50%)
- Section 2 (Framework): 2,500 words
  - Base framework: 500 words (cut 75%)
  - Section 2.2 (logic justification): 1,500 words (cut 40% from 2,400)
  - Section 2.6 (alternatives): 500 words (cut 77% from 2,200) - just summary table
- Section 3 (Born Rule + Quantum): 1,200 words
  - Born rule derivation: 800 words (cut 60%)
  - Sections 3.4+3.5: 400 words combined (cut 75%) - just key results
- Section 4 (K(N) + Validation): 2,500 words
  - Validation: 300 words (cut 80%)
  - **Section 4.5** (K(N) triple proof): 2,200 words (cut 66% from 6,500) - focus on theorems, minimize prose
- Section 5 (Lean): OMIT (move to appendix or cut entirely)
- Section 6 (Discussion): 800 words
  - General: 300 words
  - Lorentz: 500 words (cut 87% from 3,800) - just state problem + cite future work
- Section 7 (Conclusion): 500 words
- References: 100 words

**Total**: ~8,500 words ✓

**What Gets Cut**:
- Lean verification section (0 words, cite GitHub instead)
- Most discussion
- Most worked examples
- Background material (assume knowledgeable reader)
- Detailed proofs (state theorems, prove in appendix or supplement)

## Recommendation: Option B with Supplementary Material

**Main Paper**: 8,500 words (focused on results)
- K(N) triple proof (theorems + brief proofs)
- Logic justification (theorem + key idea)
- Born rule derivation (result + proof sketch)
- Validation (table + key finding)

**Supplementary Material**: Online appendix (~15,000 words)
- Complete proofs
- Lean verification details
- Alternative metrics full analysis
- Lorentz toy model complete discussion
- Extended worked examples
- Additional figures

**Advantage**: Meets journal requirements while preserving all work

## Trimming Tactics

### 1. Remove Redundancy
- Don't repeat context between sections
- State theorems once, reference later
- Combine similar examples

### 2. Use Dense Mathematical Style
- State→Proof→Result (minimal prose)
- Assume mathematical sophistication
- Use compact notation

### 3. Defer to References
- "For details see [X]" instead of explaining
- Cite standard results without proof
- Reference supplementary material

### 4. Cut Non-Essential Content
- Motivational paragraphs
- Historical context (brief only)
- Philosophical asides
- Alternative interpretations (just mention)

### 5. Compact Figures
- Combine related subfigures
- Dense captions (less text in body)
- Reference figures briefly

### 6. Streamline Structure
- Fewer subsections
- Remove transition paragraphs
- Direct statements of results
