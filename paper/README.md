# LFT Publications

## Main Publications

### Logic Field Theory Part I (Active - October 2025)

- **Logic_Field_Theory_I_Quantum_Probability.md** - Deriving quantum probability from logical constraints (v2 - peer review revisions integrated)
- **Author**: James D. (JD) Longmire
- **Status**: Ready for resubmission to Foundations of Physics
- **Target Journal**: Foundations of Physics
- **Series**: Logic Field Theory - Part I

This paper derives static quantum probabilities (Born rule) from logical consistency requirements in a non-relativistic framework.

**Peer Review Status**: All 5 reviewer concerns addressed ✅
- Moderated scope ("static probabilities" not "full QM")
- Explicit limitations stated (dynamics, Lorentz invariance)
- Honest assessment of achievements vs. open problems
