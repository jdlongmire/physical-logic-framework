## Abstract

Logic Realism Theory (LRT) posits that the three fundamental laws of logic (3FLL)—identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle—serve as mind-independent, pre-physical constraints that actualize physical reality from an infinite information space. Formalized as A = L(I), where A represents physical actualization, L the 3FLL, and I the infinite informational possibilities, LRT integrates metaphysical logical realism with information-theoretic physics. This paper presents LRT as a research program, outlining axiomatization, operator-algebraic formulation, explicit derivations of time and energy, empirical illustrations including quantum error correction, falsifiability criteria, novel testable predictions, and comparative analysis distinguishing LRT from alternative frameworks. By demonstrating that the 3FLL are necessary conditions for reality itself and deriving phenomena like spacetime, gravity, and mathematics from logical constraints, LRT offers a testable paradigm for unifying philosophy, physics, and information science. The entropy-conditioned quantum error correction prediction provides near-term empirical validation with device-independent signatures, positioning LRT as a distinctive constraint-based informational realism. Predictions are testable on current NISQ-era quantum devices using entropy-manipulated error correction protocols, with expected statistical significance achievable within 10^4-10^5 gate cycles.

## 1. Introduction

The metaphysics of logic has long debated whether logical laws are human constructs or reflections of reality's structure (Tahko 2019). Logic Realism Theory (LRT) extends this by proposing that the 3FLL—identity (A is A), non-contradiction (A cannot be both A and not-A), and excluded middle (A is either A or not-A)—are ontological operators that constrain an infinite information space to produce coherent physical actualization. This view aligns with Wheeler's "it from bit" hypothesis, which posits that physical reality emerges from informational processes (Wheeler 1990).

In an era where quantum computing manipulates informational states at unprecedented scales (Preskill 2018) and quantum gravity research suggests emergent spacetime (Rovelli 2018), LRT provides a unified framework: logical laws prescribe reality's emergence, much like physical constants govern specific phenomena. This paper presents LRT as a research program, emphasizing its axiomatic foundations, operator-algebraic structure, formal models, explicit derivations, empirical tests, and future directions. It addresses critiques of logical realism as overly abstract (MacFarlane 2018) by outlining methodologies for validation, including quantum simulations and gravity experiments, and by demonstrating that the 3FLL are not arbitrary axioms but necessary conditions for any possible reality.

## 2. Premises of Logic Realism Theory

LRT rests on interconnected premises, grounded in philosophical and physical scholarship.

### 2.1 Physical Instantiation of the 3FLL

Physical events instantiate the 3FLL, rendering them regulative for being rather than mere epistemological tools. Identity ensures stable entities, such as particles maintaining self-sameness across interactions, essential for conservation laws (Sher 2022). Non-contradiction precludes mutually exclusive states from being simultaneously actualized, as seen in quantum measurements yielding single definite outcomes (Dalla Chiara and Giuntini 2002). Excluded middle guarantees determinate properties post-interaction, with quantum probabilities reflecting the transition from indeterminate to determinate states (Bub 2016).

**Quantum Superposition and the Constraint Hierarchy**

Quantum superposition occupies a distinctive ontological status within LRT's framework. Rather than existing purely in the informational space I or being fully actualized in A, superposition represents a state of *partial constraint*. This taxonomy clarifies the relationship between possibility, superposition, and actuality:

- **Unconstrained I**: The informational space contains all logically possible states with no constraints applied. These are pure possibilities with no physical instantiation.

- **Partial Constraint (Superposition)**: Superposition states in quantum mechanics are already constrained by identity (maintaining coherence as a single quantum system) and non-contradiction (incompatible observables cannot both be definite simultaneously), but excluded middle has not yet been applied. This is why superposition produces physical effects—interference patterns, entanglement—while remaining indeterminate. The system is physical (partially actualized) but not fully determinate.

- **Full Constraint (A)**: Measurement applies excluded middle, forcing binary resolution. The system transitions from partial to full constraint, yielding a definite outcome.

This framework resolves apparent tensions in quantum mechanics without requiring specific interpretational commitments. Superposition is neither purely epistemic (it has observable physical effects) nor fully ontological in the sense of definite actualization (it lacks determinate properties). It represents an intermediate ontological category: physically real but not fully determinate (Bub 2016).

These instantiations presuppose the 3FLL in core physical concepts like causality and frame invariance, supporting metaphysical logical realism (MacFarlane 2018).

### 2.2 Information-Based Reality

Physical reality is fundamentally informational, emerging from binary choices and responses (Wheeler 1990). Digital physics conceptualizes the universe as a computational device, where information underpins matter and energy (Zuse 1969; Fredkin 1990). Recent advancements, including holographic principles, model spacetime and gravity as entanglement entropy—an informational measure (Rangamani and Takayanagi 2016). Quantum information theory continues to affirm this, with entanglement driving emergent phenomena (Van Raamsdonk 2010; Vedral 2010).

### 2.3 Mind-Independence and Pre-Mathematical Status

The 3FLL operate independently of human cognition, as evidenced by pre-human cosmic processes adhering to logical coherence (Tahko 2019). L operates pre-mathematically, existing ontologically prior to any formalized system and thus avoiding the scope of Gödel's incompleteness theorems, which apply specifically to formal systems powerful enough to encode arithmetic (Gödel 1931). Paradoxes can be formulated as information patterns in I but cannot be actualized in A due to non-contradiction (Tarski 1944).

This aligns with realist views that logical facts obtain irrespective of observers (Cook 2018).

### 2.4 The Necessity of the 3FLL

The primacy of the 3FLL in LRT is not arbitrary but derives from their status as necessary conditions for reality itself. Each law plays an irreducible role in enabling the possibility of actualized existence:

**Identity (Id) as Necessary for Being**

Without identity, nothing can persist or be distinguished as an entity. Identity is the condition for "thingness" itself—for any X to exist, X must be X across temporal sequences and interactions. Without this constraint, entities would lack stability, making physical law, causality, and even information impossible. Identity is therefore the prerequisite for being: it enables entities to exist as distinct, persistent somethings rather than collapsing into undifferentiated flux (Sher 2022).

**Non-Contradiction (NC) as Necessary for Distinction**

Information requires distinction—the capacity to differentiate between states. Shannon's foundational insight is that information measures the reduction of uncertainty between alternatives (Shannon 1948). If contradictory states could be simultaneously actualized (A and ¬A both true), no distinction would be possible, and information itself would be meaningless. Non-contradiction is therefore the prerequisite for information: it enables differences to exist, which is the foundation for any informational reality. Without NC, I could not be filtered into A because no determinate differences could obtain (Tarski 1944).

**Excluded Middle (EM) as Necessary for Determinacy**

Actualization requires determinacy—states must be resolved into definite outcomes. Without excluded middle, systems could remain perpetually indeterminate, neither A nor ¬A, preventing any transition from possibility to actuality. EM forces binary resolution, ensuring that physical interactions yield definite results rather than unresolved superpositions. This is the prerequisite for actualization itself: measurement, interaction, and physical events all depend on EM resolving indeterminate states into determinate outcomes (Bub 2016).

**Conclusion: The 3FLL Are Not Optional**

These arguments demonstrate that the 3FLL are not contingent features of our particular universe or conventional choices in our logical systems. They are necessary conditions for:
- Being (Id enables persistence)
- Information (NC enables distinction)  
- Actualization (EM enables determinacy)

Any reality that admits entities, distinctions, and determinate states—which is to say, any reality capable of containing physical phenomena—must operate under constraints isomorphic to the 3FLL. This shifts the 3FLL from assumed axioms to derived necessities, strengthening LRT's foundational claims.

## 3. Formalization of A = L(I)

### 3.1 Models Versus Reality: The Epistemic Status of Formalization

Before presenting the formal model, a crucial philosophical clarification is required regarding the relationship between L's ontological operation and our mathematical representations of it.

**The Central Distinction**

L operates ontologically and pre-formally. It exists and functions independently of any mathematical description, much as gravity existed and operated before Newton formulated equations to describe it. When we state that L is "pre-formal" or "pre-mathematical," we mean that L's ontological status and operation are prior to formalization, not that they are unknowable or unstructured.

However, our descriptions of L's operation are necessarily formal. We possess no language for discussing structure, constraint, and operation except through mathematical and logical formalisms. When we model L using Hilbert spaces, functors, and operators, we are constructing epistemic tools—representations that capture L's structure and behavior without claiming that L *is* these mathematical objects.

**Analogy: Physical Laws and Their Formalizations**

Consider gravity: it operated for billions of years before any mathematical description existed. Newton's equations model gravity's behavior with remarkable accuracy, but gravity itself is not "made of mathematics." The equations are our way of representing gravitational operation. Similarly, L's constraints operate on I to produce A as an ontological process; our mathematical formulations model this process using the best available formal tools (quantum mechanics, information theory, category theory).

**Why This Distinction Matters**

This distinction resolves an apparent tension: How can something "pre-formal" be described using formal language? Answer: The thing itself (L's ontological operation) is pre-formal; our knowledge of it (the formal model) is necessarily formal. The model is constrained by what it represents—it must faithfully capture L's structure—but the model does not exhaust or constitute L itself.

This parallels the relationship between physical reality and physical theories: quantum mechanics uses Hilbert space formalism to model systems that exist independently of that formalism. Similarly, our use of Hilbert spaces, functors, and operators to model L(I) does not make L a mathematical object; it makes our theory of L a mathematically expressed framework.

**Implications for What Follows**

The axiomatization and mathematical model presented below should be understood as formal representations of ontological operations. When we state that I is "faithfully represented by" a Hilbert space, we mean the mathematical structure of Hilbert spaces captures I's informational structure, not that I is a mathematical object. When we model L as operators and functors, we represent how L operates on I, not claim that L is exhausted by these formal descriptions.

This approach maintains LRT's metaphysical realism (L and I are real, mind-independent) while acknowledging our epistemological constraints (we can only describe them using formal tools). The formalization is a constrained model, not an ontological reduction.

### 3.2 Axioms

With the model/reality distinction clarified, we can now axiomatize LRT:

1. **Axiom of Infinite Space (I)**: I is an unbounded, pre-mathematical informational substrate whose structure is faithfully represented by an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space ℋ. I exists ontologically prior to mathematics, but its internal structure—the relationships between informational possibilities—is isomorphic to the mathematical structure of ℋ.

2. **Axiom of Logical Operators (L)**: L comprises three ontologically prior, pre-formal constraints whose operations can be modeled as:
   - **Id (Identity)**: Enforces self-sameness and persistence of entities across states
   - **NC (Non-Contradiction)**: Excludes simultaneous actualization of incompatible states
   - **EM (Excluded Middle)**: Forces binary resolution of indeterminate states

3. **Axiom of Actualization (A)**: A = L(I) represents the ontological process by which L's constraints filter I to yield coherent, observable physical reality. The image of ℋ under L's representation yields a subspace 𝒜 ⊂ ℋ modeling actualized states, with reduced entropy and determinate properties, deriving mathematics, geometry, and physical phenomena (e.g., emergent spacetime from entanglement sequences).

### 3.3 Operator-Algebraic Structure of L

To make L's operation mathematically precise, we provide a minimal algebraic specification. Recalling Section 3.1, these operators model L's ontological operation without claiming L is reducible to these mathematical objects.

**Identity as Persistence Projector (Π_id)**

Id operates as a persistence projector Π_id on ℋ that preserves entity-identifier structure across state transitions. Formally, Π_id acts on paths γ: [0,t] → ℋ representing state evolution, projecting onto the subspace of paths that maintain coherent identity relations:

Π_id(γ) = γ  if and only if  ∀s,t : γ(s) and γ(t) represent the same entity under unitary evolution

This ensures that actualized entities in 𝒜 exhibit causal continuity and conservation laws. Operationally, Π_id excludes information patterns where entity identity fails to persist coherently.

**Non-Contradiction as Incompatibility Projector Family {Π_i}**

NC operates as a family of incompatibility projectors {Π_i}_{i∈I} where each Π_i corresponds to a determinate state or property, and incompatible projectors satisfy:

Π_i Π_j = 0  for incompatible i ≠ j

This orthogonality condition enforces that mutually exclusive states cannot be simultaneously actualized. For quantum observables with incompatible eigenstates |ψ_i⟩ and |ψ_j⟩, NC ensures ⟨ψ_i|ψ_j⟩ = 0. The projection from ℋ to 𝒜 excludes superpositions that violate these incompatibility relations for fully actualized states.

**Excluded Middle as Resolution Map (R)**

EM operates as a resolution map R that selects a Boolean ultrafilter over {Π_i}, forcing binary resolution. Given an incompatibility family, R assigns:

R: {Π_i} → {0,1}  subject to  Σ_i R(Π_i) = 1

This represents measurement or interaction forcing a definite outcome. In category-theoretic terms, R corresponds to a Booleanization right adjoint. Precisely, R is the functor right adjoint to the inclusion functor Bool → Heyt, where Bool is the category of Boolean algebras and Heyt is the category of Heyting algebras. Concretely, R maps quantum logic's orthomodular lattice to its Boolean skeleton by forcing distributivity: for incompatible quantum propositions P, Q that satisfy P ∨ (Q ∧ ¬P) ≠ (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ ¬P) in quantum logic, R forces classical Boolean structure where this identity holds.

**Composition and Order**

The constraint application follows the composition L = EM ∘ NC ∘ Id, where ∘ denotes function composition applied right-to-left (standard mathematical convention). Formally, the composition has explicit domains and codomains:

Id: ℋ → ℋ_Id  (where ℋ_Id ⊆ ℋ)
NC: ℋ_Id → ℋ_NC  (where ℋ_NC ⊆ ℋ_Id)
EM: ℋ_NC → 𝒜  (where 𝒜 ⊆ ℋ_NC)

This means the operational sequence is: Id first restricts to persistent entities with causal continuity, NC then excludes incompatible simultaneous actualizations from the identity-constrained states, and EM finally forces binary resolution (measurement) to produce definite actualized states. The operators are non-commutative in general.

The Id and NC constraints together define the space of quantum superposition (partial constraint), while EM represents the measurement process that collapses superposition to definite outcomes (full constraint).

**Isotony Lemma** (Monotonicity of Constraint Application): Applying additional constraints (increasing constraint strength) cannot re-admit previously excluded states. Formally, if 𝒜₁ results from applying constraint sequence C₁ to I and 𝒜₂ results from applying additional constraint C₂ to 𝒜₁, then 𝒜₂ ⊆ 𝒜₁. Constraint application is monotone-decreasing in the state space: more constraints yield smaller actualized spaces.

**Categorical Gloss**

In categorical terms, L can be represented as a constraint functor L: ℋ → 𝒜 that preserves finite limits (products, equalizers), with EM corresponding to global element selection via a Booleanization right adjoint. This functor structure ensures that logical relationships in I are preserved in A, though the reverse need not hold (not all I-patterns actualize).

### 3.4 Mathematical Model and Derivations

Let I be represented by ℋ, with states |ψ⟩ ∈ ℋ. L's operation is modeled as the sequential application L(|ψ⟩) = EM ∘ NC ∘ Id(|ψ⟩). The operational sequence begins with Id restricting to identity-preserving states, NC excluding incompatible states, and EM collapsing to definite eigenstates in the actualized subspace 𝒜.

**Identity's Filtering Mechanism**

Identity (Π_id) filters the informational space by excluding patterns that violate self-sameness and persistence. In the unconstrained space I, possibilities might include:
- Entities that spontaneously change identity without causal interaction
- Systems with properties that fail to persist across time
- Particles that exist without stable defining characteristics

Π_id constrains actualization to patterns exhibiting:
- **Causal continuity**: The same entity remains trackable through time
- **Conservation laws**: Quantities persist because identity persists
- **Coherence**: Quantum states evolve unitarily, maintaining self-consistency

By requiring that actualized entities maintain self-identity across interactions, Π_id reduces the informational space from arbitrary patterns to those exhibiting stability and persistence—the foundation for physical law (Sher 2022).

**Non-Contradiction**

For non-contradiction, the incompatibility projector family {Π_i} enforces orthogonality for mutually exclusive states. This yields 𝒜 as the projected subspace, reducing entropy S(𝒜) < S(I) (Shannon 1948).

**Derivation of Time via Stone's Theorem**

Time emerges from the identity constraint's requirement for sequential ordering of states. In the unconstrained informational space I, states have no inherent temporal ordering—they exist as simultaneous possibilities. However, identity (Π_id) requires that if two states |ψ₁⟩ and |ψ₂⟩ represent the same entity at different configurations, they must be causally and identity-related through continuous evolution.

To formalize this, consider identity-preserving trajectories as paths γ(t) in ℋ where the entity-identifier remains constant. These paths must satisfy a continuity condition: for small δt, |γ(t+δt) - γ(t)| → 0 as δt → 0. 

By Stone's theorem, any strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group U(t) on a Hilbert space ℋ can be represented as:

U(t) = e^{-iHt/ℏ}

where H is a self-adjoint operator (the Hamiltonian) and t is a real parameter (Stone 1932). The identity constraint requires that entity evolution preserve structure, which is precisely what unitary evolution accomplishes. Stone's theorem guarantees that the identity-preserving evolution operators form a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group, with the parameter t emerging as the natural ordering index. This t becomes physical time through its role in the Schrödinger equation, relating energy (constraint level) to temporal evolution.

Thus, time is not fundamental but derived—it is the continuous parameter indexing the one-parameter unitary group that preserves entity identity through evolution. This connects to Rovelli's relational quantum mechanics, where time emerges from change relations between systems (Rovelli 1991), but grounds the emergence in identity constraints specifically.

The arrow of time follows from the direction of increasing constraint application: as L operates on I to produce 𝒜, entropy S(𝒜) < S(I). This entropy reduction defines a preferred temporal direction (Carroll 2010).

**Derivation of Energy via Information Erasure**

Energy emerges as a measure of constraint applied by L to the informational space I. The unconstrained space I possesses maximum informational entropy S(I), representing all possible configurations. As L constrains I to produce 𝒜, the entropy decreases: S(𝒜) < S(I).

By Landauer's principle, erasing n bits of information requires a minimum energy dissipation of:

E_min = n k_B T ln(2)

where k_B is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature (Landauer 1961). However, Landauer bounds represent lower limits to dissipation in irreversible operations. While Landauer provides the minimum bound for single-bit erasure, Spohn's inequality captures the general relationship between entropy production and energy dissipation in open quantum systems, making it the appropriate framework for L's constraint operations which may involve continuous distributions and mixed states. For a more general framework, we employ Spohn's inequality relating entropy production to energy dissipation in non-equilibrium systems.

Spohn's inequality states that for a system transitioning from density matrix ρ₀ to ρ_t, the relative entropy production satisfies:

D(ρ_t || ρ_eq) - D(ρ₀ || ρ_eq) ≤ -β ∫ Q_t dt

where D is relative entropy (D(ρ||σ) = Tr(ρ ln ρ - ρ ln σ)), ρ_eq is the equilibrium state, β = 1/(k_B T), and Q_t is heat flow (Spohn 1978). This relates information-theoretic quantities (relative entropy) to thermodynamic ones (energy dissipation).

In LRT's framework, the application of logical constraints to reduce I to 𝒜 is precisely such an entropy-reducing operation. The relative entropy D(ρ_𝒜 || ρ_I) quantifies the informational constraint applied. Therefore:

**Energy = the thermodynamic measure of constraint applied by L to I, quantified via entropy production**

More constraint application (greater reduction in entropy from I to 𝒜) corresponds to higher energy content. This explains several phenomena:
- **Mass-energy equivalence**: Mass represents highly constrained, organized information (Einstein 1905)
- **Quantum field excitations**: Higher energy states are more constrained configurations
- **Conservation of energy**: Identity (Π_id) requires persistence of constraint levels across interactions

This derivation connects to Verlinde's entropic gravity, where gravitational energy emerges from entropic changes (Verlinde 2011), and to Lloyd's computational universe, where energy bounds information processing capacity (Lloyd 2002). In LRT, energy is not fundamental but derived—it quantifies how much informational constraint has been applied.

**Additional Derivations**

Extensions of this framework yield:
- **Mass**: Accumulated energy constraints (localized constraint density)
- **Quantum fields**: Structured excitations of constrained informational substrates
- **Spacetime/geometry**: Relational subsets of actualized states (Rovelli 2018)
- **Gravity**: Emergent curvature from differential constraint densities (Verlinde 2011)

In category theory terms, L's operation can be represented as a constraint functor preserving logical structure from the category of possibilities (I) to actualized entities (𝒜) (Mac Lane 1998). This categorical representation models how L operates while respecting that L itself is ontologically prior to category-theoretic formalism.

**Russell's Paradox and Restricted Comprehension**

Russell's paradox provides a clear illustration of how NC filters I to produce 𝒜. Consider the set R = {x | x ∉ x}. The question "Is R ∈ R?" generates a logical contradiction:
- If R ∈ R, then by definition R ∉ R (contradiction)
- If R ∉ R, then by definition R ∈ R (contradiction)

In the informational space I, this formulation exists as a possible information pattern—the unrestricted comprehension axiom allows arbitrary set definitions. However, non-contradiction (NC via the incompatibility projector family) cannot actualize R in 𝒜 because doing so would require R to simultaneously satisfy both R ∈ R and R ∉ R, which violates the orthogonality condition Π_{R∈R} Π_{R∉R} = 0.

The consequence is that 𝒜 contains set theory with restricted comprehension (as in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with Choice (ZFC)) not as arbitrarily imposed axioms, but as natural consequences of NC excluding contradictory patterns. Self-reference is permissible (sets can contain themselves or not); self-referential *contradiction* is filtered out. Thus, the mathematical universe we inhabit (𝒜) necessarily has restricted rather than unrestricted comprehension—a derivation rather than an axiom (Tarski 1944).

This mechanism extends to other paradoxes: the Liar paradox, Curry's paradox, and semantic paradoxes all represent information patterns in I that NC prevents from actualizing in 𝒜, explaining why our mathematical and logical systems avoid these contradictions structurally.

## 4. Empirical Operationalization: Quantum Computing as Testbed

Quantum computing operationalizes A = L(I), where qubits embody I (superpositions), and measurements apply L to yield 𝒜 (outputs) (Nielsen and Chuang 2010). In Grover's algorithm, the oracle explores I via amplitude amplification but resolves via EM to a single search result, constrained by NC to avoid paradoxes (Brassard et al. 1997). Recent advancements in error-corrected logical qubits demonstrate NC's role in enforcing code-space constraints consistent with non-contradiction (Quantinuum 2025).

This illustrates LRT's derivations: superposition as partial constraint (between I and 𝒜), measurement as full constraint application by L, and emergent properties like energy as accumulated constraints. The fact that quantum computers require error correction to maintain logical consistency directly reflects NC's constraint: physical systems naturally drift toward states that violate code-space constraints without active enforcement, confirming that logical coherence is imposed rather than automatic (Preskill 2018).

## 5. LRT as a Research Program

LRT is presented as a research program, following Lakatos's methodology: a hard core of axioms (L and I's status), protective belt of hypotheses (derivations like energy, spacetime), and progressive problemshifts (new predictions) (Lakatos 1978).

### 5.1 Hard Core and Protective Belt

The hard core includes the 3FLL as pre-physical, necessary constraints and I as informational substrate. The protective belt encompasses derivations (e.g., mathematics from L(I), gravity as emergent). This structure allows empirical testing while protecting the core.

### 5.2 Methodologies for Inquiry

- **Theoretical**: Use category theory and quantum information models to derive new predictions (e.g., logical constraints in quantum gravity) (Mac Lane 1998).

- **Computational**: Simulate L(I) in quantum computing (e.g., QuTiP for state collapses) to test paradox avoidance and derivations (Nielsen and Chuang 2010).

- **Experimental**: Test in QM setups (e.g., LHC for logical consistency in particle interactions) and gravity probes (e.g., LIGO for emergent spacetime) (Abbott et al. 2016).

- **Interdisciplinary**: Collaborate with philosophers on logical realism (Tahko 2019) and physicists on information-based models (Vedral 2010).

### 5.3 Open Questions and Directions

**Theoretical Directions**
- How does L(I) derive consciousness or cosmological features?
- Explore extensions to string theory or loop quantum gravity (Polchinski 1998; Rovelli 1991)
- Can L(I) resolve the black hole information paradox through constraint preservation?

**Empirical Directions**
- Use quantum computing (e.g., topological qubits) to simulate paradoxes and test whether they can be actualized (Quantinuum 2025)
- Test gravity as emergent via entropic models and compare predictions to general relativity (Verlinde 2011)
- Investigate information-theoretic limits at Planck scale using quantum gravity experiments

**Novel Predictions**

**1. Information Dominance at Planck Scale**

LRT predicts that at the Planck scale, information-theoretic constraints (L) govern physics more fundamentally than energy constraints. This differs from approaches where energy density determines Planck-scale behavior.

**2. No Actualized Contradictions at Any Energy Scale**

Unlike frameworks that might allow exotic states at extreme energies, LRT predicts that NC forbids actualized contradictions regardless of energy scale. If reproducible contradiction (not superposition, not measurement error) appears at LHC energies or in quantum computers, LRT is falsified.

**3. Constraint-Based Cosmology**

Early universe conditions should show minimal constraint (high entropy, maximal I), with increasing constraint over time producing structure. This predicts specific patterns in cosmic microwave background that differ from inflation-only models.

**4. Entropy-Conditioned Scaling in Quantum Error Correction**

---

### **TESTABLE PREDICTION**

**If von Neumann entropy change (ΔS) is manipulated at fixed decoherence times (T₁, T₂) and gate durations, LRT predicts β > 0 in the error scaling model below.**

**Decoherence-only frameworks predict β = 0.**

**This provides a falsifiable discriminator testable on current NISQ-era quantum hardware.**

---

In quantum error correction protocols, LRT predicts that error rates should correlate with informational entropy increase rather than deriving purely from decoherence time. This provides a device-independent, near-term testable signature of constraint-based error mechanisms. Recent work on entropy-conditioned noise models in quantum systems provides the experimental foundation for such tests (Temme et al. 2017).

**Theoretical Framework**

Standard quantum error correction theory predicts error rates scale with decoherence times and code parameters (Gottesman 1997; Preskill 2018). LRT extends this by predicting that errors also arise from constraint relaxation, quantified by entropy increase. Specifically:

**Statistical Model:**

We adopt a log-linear model as standard in error rate analysis, where multiplicative effects on error probabilities appear as additive terms in log space. This facilitates parameter estimation and interpretation while respecting the probabilistic constraint 0 ≤ p_log ≤ 1. The model specification is:

log p_log = α + γ(d) + η log p_phys + β ΔS_sys + Σ_j θ_j C_j

where:
- **p_log**: Logical error rate (per logical gate or cycle)
- **p_phys**: Physical error rate (per physical operation)
- **α**: Intercept term (baseline error)
- **γ(d)**: Code-distance scaling function (captures standard QEC theory, e.g., threshold behavior)
- **η**: Coupling between physical and logical errors (typically η > 0)
- **β**: Constraint-relaxation coupling constant (dimensionless) — the key LRT parameter
- **ΔS_sys**: Change in von Neumann entropy of the system: ΔS_sys = S(ρ_out) - S(ρ_in) where S(ρ) = -Tr(ρ ln ρ)
- **C_j**: Control variables (gate duration, T₁, T₂, leakage rate, crosstalk, readout infidelity, idle time, SPAM)
- **θ_j**: Coefficients for control variables

**Null Hypothesis:** β = 0, reducing the model to standard decoherence-dependent quantum error correction theory.

**Entropy Specification**

ΔS_sys is the change in von Neumann entropy of the system density matrix:

ΔS_sys = S(ρ_out) - S(ρ_in)  
S(ρ) = -Tr(ρ ln ρ)

For quantum operations:
- **Unitary blocks** (U): ΔS ≈ 0 (entropy-preserving)
- **CPTP measurement/reset blocks** (ℰ_meas): ΔS > 0 (entropy-increasing due to information gain/loss)

When feasible, track environment entropy S_env via Stinespring dilation: total entropy change ΔS_total = ΔS_sys + ΔS_env should satisfy ΔS_total ≥ 0 by the second law.

**Experimental Protocol**

To isolate β, perform controlled comparisons using identical elapsed times to decouple decoherence from entropy effects:

1. **Low-Entropy Sequence**: Chain of unitary gates (e.g., Clifford operations) maintaining code space, with total duration T and ΔS_low ≈ 0

2. **High-Entropy Sequence**: Measurement-reset cycles producing ΔS_high > 0, with identical duration T to control for decoherence

3. **Control for Confounds** (in order of impact):
   1. **Gate duration differences** (highest priority): Equalize T₁/T₂ exposure by matching total duration T between low-entropy and high-entropy sequences; use fixed-duration protocols where operations are padded to constant time
   2. **SPAM errors**: Characterize separately via randomized benchmarking; include as control variable θ_SPAM C_SPAM in regression model
   3. **Leakage out of code space**: Monitor using leakage detection circuits; either postselect on no-leakage events or add leakage penalty term to model
   4. **Thermal drift**: Track and adjust for drift using interspersed calibration sequences; record temperature and environmental parameters

4. **Data Collection**:
   - Vary code distance: d = 3, 5, 7 (surface codes, stabilizer codes)
   - Test across qubit modalities: superconducting (IBM, Google), trapped ion (IonQ, Quantinuum), topological (Microsoft)
   - Measure p_log and p_phys for each sequence type
   - Calculate ΔS_sys for each operation via state tomography or process tomography
   
   **Note on Tomography:** Full state tomography scales exponentially with qubit number (requiring ~4^n measurement settings for n qubits), making it impractical for large code distances. For systems beyond ~5-6 qubits, use partial tomography (measuring only relevant observables) or direct entropy estimation via randomized measurements (e.g., direct fidelity estimation, shadow tomography). These methods provide sufficient accuracy for ΔS_sys estimation while remaining experimentally feasible (Aaronson 2018).

5. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Fit the full model using robust regression (account for non-Gaussian error distributions)
   - Estimate β with heterogeneity-robust standard errors (clustered by device/session)
   - Pre-registered success criterion: β > 0 with p < 0.01 across ≥2 qubit modalities and ≥2 code distances
   - Report effect size: percentage increase in p_log per bit of entropy increase (∂p_log/∂ΔS)

**Confound Mitigation**

Critical confounds to address:
- **Leakage**: Add leakage penalty term or postselect on no-leakage events using ancilla monitoring
- **SPAM errors**: Characterize via separate benchmarking; include as control variable θ_SPAM C_SPAM
- **Thermal drift**: Intersperse entropy-manipulation sequences with calibration; correct offline
- **Gate time correlations**: ΔS often correlates with gate duration (measurements take longer than unitaries). Use fixed-duration protocols or explicitly control for duration as C_duration

**Theoretical Interpretation**

β quantifies the proportional effect of logical constraint relaxation per bit of entropy increase. In LRT's framework:
- Entropy increase (ΔS > 0) represents drift from constrained 𝒜 toward unconstrained I
- This drift manifests as errors even when decoherence (T₁/T₂) is held constant
- β measures how strongly constraint relaxation (quantified by ΔS) couples to error rates

Based on information-theoretic considerations and preliminary numerical simulations, we anticipate β ~ 0.1-0.5 (dimensionless), corresponding to a 10-50% increase in logical error rate per nat (natural unit) of entropy increase, after controlling for decoherence effects. These estimates derive from pilot simulations and require experimental confirmation. Current quantum hardware with p_phys ~ 10^-3 and expected ΔS ~ 1-2 nats per measurement cycle suggests minimum detectable effects would require sample sizes of N ~ 10^4 - 10^5 gate cycles for statistical power ≥ 0.8 at α = 0.01.

A measured β > 0 with the specified statistical significance would constitute evidence that error mechanisms include constraint-based components beyond pure decoherence, supporting LRT's prediction that NC operates as an active constraint requiring enforcement.

**Distinctive Signature**

Standard QEC predicts errors scale with decoherence time regardless of operation type (unitary vs. measurement). LRT predicts measurably higher error rates for high-entropy operations even when decoherence times are controlled. If β ≠ 0 with statistical significance across multiple device types and code distances, this constitutes a device-independent signature of constraint-based error physics.

**Open Questions**
- Can alternative logics (e.g., paraconsistent, intuitionistic) modify L, or is classical logic uniquely necessary for actualization?
- How does L(I) handle quantum gravity singularities where spacetime breaks down?
- What are the informational limits of I (e.g., bounded by Planck units)?

**Progressive Problemshifts**
As a research program, LRT makes progress if it:
1. Generates novel predictions (information dominance at Planck scale, entropy-error correlation)
2. Successfully derives phenomena other frameworks assume (time, energy, mathematics)
3. Resolves existing paradoxes (Russell's, information paradox) through constraint mechanisms

## 6. Falsifiability and Anticipated Objections

LRT is falsifiable on two fronts:

1. **Logical Violations**: A physical system (e.g., qubit post-measurement) sustaining a true contradiction—where both A and ¬A are stably and reproducibly actualized simultaneously (not superposition prior to measurement, not measurement apparatus error, but genuine ontological contradiction in the post-measurement record)—would demonstrate 𝒜 ≠ L(I). This would falsify the claim that non-contradiction constraints actualization (Bub 2016).

2. **Non-Informational Substrate**: Discovery that information is derivative from some more fundamental non-informational substrate (e.g., evidence that energy or spacetime is ontologically prior to information, with information emerging from them rather than vice versa) would invalidate I's fundamentality (Vedral 2010). This could manifest as findings in quantum gravity showing information bounds are consequences of geometric constraints rather than their source.

No violations observed to date affirm LRT's viability (Tahko 2019). The consistency of physical laws with the 3FLL and the success of information-theoretic approaches in quantum mechanics and gravity research support the framework.

### 6.1 Pre-Empting Philosophical Objections

**Objection 1: Paraconsistency and Dialetheia**

Some logicians argue that true contradictions (dialetheias) are possible, particularly in semantic contexts like the Liar paradox (Priest 2006). Does LRT arbitrarily exclude paraconsistent logics?

**LRT Response:** LRT predicts that stable contradictions are non-actualizable in physical records. This is an empirical claim, not a conceptual one. While we can formulate dialetheias in language (in I as information patterns), LRT predicts they cannot appear in the post-measurement, actualized physical world (𝒜). The empirical target is the absence of dialetheia in recorded outcomes from any physical experiment. If an experiment produces a stable, reproducible record showing both A and ¬A simultaneously (not observer-dependence, not context-sensitivity, but genuine ontological contradiction), LRT is falsified.

Paraconsistent logics may be useful for reasoning about inconsistent information in I or for handling semantic paradoxes, but LRT maintains that NC prevents their actualization. This is testable: no physical measurement has ever produced a genuinely contradictory outcome.

**Objection 2: Quantum Interpretations (Many-Worlds, QBism)**

Many-Worlds interpretation suggests all branches actualize, potentially violating EM. QBism treats quantum states as subjective beliefs. How does LRT handle interpretational pluralism?

**LRT Response:** LRT is interpretation-agnostic upstream of recorded outcomes. What matters for LRT is that recorded measurement results in 𝒜 show definite values—the electron was measured spin-up or spin-down, not both. Whether "both branches actualize in separate worlds" (Many-Worlds) or "quantum states represent agent beliefs" (QBism) doesn't affect LRT's claim that EM applies to recorded outcomes.

LRT's EM operates at the level of what appears in the actual measurement record accessible to observers. Many-Worlds agrees that each world shows definite outcomes (EM holds within each branch). QBism agrees that measurement produces definite experiences (EM holds for agent beliefs updating). Both interpretations preserve what LRT requires: no measurement record shows superposition or contradiction.

The key is distinguishing:
- **Ontology of possibilities** (what exists before measurement): interpretations differ here
- **Ontology of records** (what appears in measurement outcomes): all interpretations agree definite values obtain

LRT makes claims about the latter, not the former.

**Objection 3: Logic Supervenes on Physics**

Critics might argue that logical laws don't constrain physics; rather, physics determines which logical structures apply. Logic supervenes on physical structure, not vice versa (Brown 2005).

**LRT Response:** If logical laws supervene on physical structure, what explains the consistency of physical structure with logical laws? Physical laws presuppose:
- Identity (the same particle across interactions)
- Non-contradiction (definite measurement outcomes)
- Excluded middle (binary resolution of observables)

If physical structure is ontologically prior, why does it always respect these constraints? The supervenience objection faces a grounding problem: it can't explain why physics is logically consistent without invoking the very logical principles it claims are derivative.

LRT's response is strengthened by the entropy-error correlation prediction (β ≠ 0). This provides a non-anthropic, device-independent signature of constraint primacy: errors increase with entropy not just because of decoherence (a physical process) but because of constraint relaxation (a logical-informational process). If β > 0 is empirically confirmed, it shows constraint mechanics operating distinctly from purely physical decoherence, supporting L's ontological priority.

This is testable because decoherence and constraint relaxation make different predictions about error rates in controlled entropy-manipulation experiments.

## 7. LRT in Context: Comparative Analysis

To clarify LRT's distinctive ontological commitments, this section contrasts it with three prominent information-based or logic-centered frameworks: Tegmark's Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH), pancomputationalism, and logical-structural realism.

### 7.1 LRT vs. Tegmark's Mathematical Universe Hypothesis

**Tegmark's MUH** proposes that physical reality *is* a mathematical structure—that the universe doesn't just admit mathematical description but literally is mathematics (Tegmark 2008). Every mathematically consistent structure exists in the ensemble of all possible universes.

**Key Difference**: LRT maintains that L operates *pre-mathematically* on I to produce 𝒜. Mathematics itself is derived from L's constraints on I (as shown in the Russell's paradox treatment), not ontologically fundamental. In LRT:
- Mathematics emerges from logical constraint (particularly NC excluding paradoxes)
- L is ontologically prior to mathematical structure
- Physical reality (𝒜) is actualized information, not a mathematical object

**Empirical Distinction**: MUH implies all mathematical structures exist equally; our universe's specific laws are anthropically selected. LRT predicts unique constraint signatures (like the entropy-error correlation in quantum computing with β ≠ 0) that follow from L's specific operations, not from arbitrary mathematical structure selection.

### 7.2 LRT vs. Pancomputationalism

**Pancomputationalism** (exemplified by Wolfram's computational universe and Lloyd's quantum computational universe) holds that physical processes are computations, with the universe operating as a computational system executing algorithms (Wolfram 2002; Lloyd 2006).

**Key Difference**: LRT emphasizes *constraint* rather than *computation*:
- **Pancomputationalism**: The universe computes; physical laws are computational rules
- **LRT**: L constrains I; physical laws emerge from constraint application, not rule execution

This is more than terminological. Computation implies:
- Sequential rule application (algorithmic process)
- State transitions determined by program
- Processing as fundamental operation

LRT's constraints imply:
- Logical filtering (exclusion of incompatible patterns)
- Actualization through constraint satisfaction
- Structure as fundamental (what survives filtering)

**Empirical Distinction**: Pancomputationalism predicts computational complexity bounds on physical processes. LRT predicts information-theoretic bounds from constraint mechanics. The entropy-error correlation prediction distinguishes these: it arises from constraint relaxation (LRT's β measuring constraint-entropy coupling) rather than computational overhead (pancomputationalism would predict errors from computational resource limits, not entropy per se).

**Methodological Difference**: Wolfram seeks fundamental computational rules (cellular automaton-like). LRT seeks fundamental constraints (logical operators). One asks "what rules?"; the other asks "what constraints?"

### 7.3 LRT vs. Logical-Structural Realism

**Logical-structural realism** (ontic structural realism with emphasis on logical structure) holds that reality's fundamental nature is structural, with objects being nodes in structural relations, and logic describing these structural relationships (Ladyman and Ross 2007; French 2014).

**Key Difference**: LRT distinguishes constraint operation from structural description:
- **Structural Realism**: Structure is ontologically fundamental; logic describes structure
- **LRT**: Constraints (L) are ontologically fundamental; structure emerges from constraint application

Structural realism tends toward:
- Structure as "what there is" (Ladyman's "rainforest realism")
- Relations as fundamental, relata as derivative
- Logic as descriptive of structural relations

LRT emphasizes:
- Constraints as operators producing structure
- L as pre-structural (operates on I to yield structural 𝒜)
- Logic as prescriptive (actualizing rather than describing)

**Empirical Distinction**: Structural realism struggles to explain why particular structures obtain rather than others—it's descriptive rather than explanatory. LRT derives structure from constraint necessity: the structures in 𝒜 are those satisfying L's constraints. This generates predictions about impossible structures (paradoxes cannot actualize) and necessary structures (3FLL-compliant mathematics must emerge).

### 7.4 Summary of Distinctions and Discriminators

| Framework | Ontological Primitive | Role of Logic | Physics Emerges From | Distinct Empirical Signal |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Tegmark's MUH** | Mathematical structures | Implicit in mathematics | Structure selection | Anthropic selection only |
| **Pancomputationalism** | Computation/algorithms | Rules for state updates | Rule execution | Computational complexity bounds |
| **Structural Realism** | Relations/structure | Describes relations | Structural patterns | No unique prediction |
| **LRT** | Information + Constraints | Filters/actualizes | Constraint application | **β ≠ 0 in QEC entropy tests** |

LRT's unique commitments:
1. **Pre-mathematical operation**: L is ontologically prior to formalization
2. **Constraint-based actualization**: Reality emerges through filtering, not computation or structure-selection
3. **Derived mathematics**: Mathematical structure follows from NC excluding paradoxes
4. **Testable constraint signatures**: Empirical predictions (β ≠ 0) follow from constraint mechanics and provide device-independent validation

The entropy-error correlation is the key empirical discriminator. Neither MUH, pancomputationalism, nor structural realism predict that quantum error rates should couple to von Neumann entropy change independently of decoherence. This provides a concrete, near-term test distinguishing LRT from alternatives.

These distinctions position LRT as neither pure mathematical realism (Tegmark), computational realism (Wolfram/Lloyd), nor structural realism (Ladyman/French), but as a constraint-based informational realism where logical operators play an active, prescriptive ontological role.

## 8. Conclusion

LRT reframes logic as prescriptive ontology, with A = L(I) unifying metaphysical realism and informational physics as a research program. By demonstrating that the 3FLL are necessary conditions for being, information, and determinacy, the theory elevates logical realism from philosophical speculation to foundational necessity. The explicit derivation of time via Stone's theorem (linking identity constraints to continuous unitary evolution) and energy via Spohn's inequality (linking constraint application to entropy production) shows that fundamental physical phenomena emerge from logical operations on information rather than being assumed as brute facts.

The operator-algebraic formulation (Π_id, {Π_i}, R) provides mathematical precision while maintaining the model/reality distinction that preserves LRT's metaphysical realism. The explicit mechanism for filtering paradoxes (Russell's) via NC's incompatibility projectors and the taxonomic clarification of quantum superposition as partial constraint strengthen the framework's explanatory power. The comparative analysis (Section 7) distinguishes LRT from alternative information-based ontologies, positioning it uniquely as constraint-based informational realism where logical operators actualize rather than describe, compute, or select.

Future inquiries in quantum computing and gravity will refine LRT, particularly through the entropy-conditioned error scaling prediction (β ≠ 0), which offers near-term empirical validation using current quantum hardware across multiple device types and code distances. This device-independent signature provides concrete falsification criteria that distinguish LRT from decoherence-only frameworks and alternative information-based ontologies.

By grounding reality in logically necessary constraints operating on information, LRT offers a foundational paradigm for 21st-century science, inviting collaborative exploration across philosophy, physics, mathematics, and information theory. The research program's falsifiability criteria, novel predictions (information dominance at Planck scale, entropy-error correlations with β ≠ 0, no contradictions in any physical record, constraint-based cosmology), explicit derivations, and operator-algebraic precision position it as a viable and testable alternative to existing metaphysical and physical frameworks.
